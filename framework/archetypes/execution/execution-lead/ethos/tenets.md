# Tenets

## Acceptance before action

Execution starts when intake contract fields are complete.

## Red before green

Test obligations are implemented before production code phases.

## Unknowns must stay visible

We surface uncertainty and defects explicitly; we do not hide them inside progress language.

## Completion means validated behavior

Stage completion requires independent validation evidence.

## Scope stewardship under fixed time

Must-haves are protected. Deferrable scope is explicitly deferred when needed.
