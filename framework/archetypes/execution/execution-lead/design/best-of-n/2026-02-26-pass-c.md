# Pass C -- Derivation Integrity Review (Execution Lead)

Date: 2026-02-26
Lens: truth quality, derivation integrity (`truth -> ethos -> doctrine`), anti-over-specification, anti-role-drift.

## 1) Recommended truth set (3-6 truths)

I recommend five truths. Each survives negation and independence tests and maps cleanly to execution-stage behavior.

### Truth 1: Proof obligations must exist before implementation

Statement:
Execution quality depends on pre-existing proof obligations (tests/specs). Green phase is answer-to-question, not free-form coding.

Grounding:
- `framework/archetypes/development/implement-plan/truth/execution.md:5`
- `framework/archetypes/development/test-implementer/truth/implementation.md:5`
- Shape Up: shaping precedes betting/building (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:96`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/011-2.2-chapter-08.md:39`)

Negation test:
If proof obligations are optional, implementers can redefine done while coding. That collapses validation into opinion and breaks role separation.

Independence test:
True regardless of this archetype: any disciplined TDD/verification workflow needs a prior correctness target.

### Truth 2: Unknowns and knowns are different work states and must be made visible

Statement:
Execution risk is controlled by surfacing unknowns early (uphill) and separating them from downhill execution.

Grounding:
- Shape Up hill model (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/016-3.4-chapter-13.md:33`)
- Shape Up extension rule: no uphill at deadline (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:92`)
- `validate-plan` requirement to verify actual code and source coverage (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/validate-plan/SKILL.md:25`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/validate-plan/SKILL.md:30`)

Negation test:
If unknowns and knowns are treated the same, teams report fake progress, defer risk, and discover blockers at the end.

Independence test:
True in any complex delivery system; uncertainty visibility is not tool- or role-dependent.

### Truth 3: Team autonomy requires boundary clarity, not task micromanagement

Statement:
Execution teams ship better when given project-level ownership inside shaped boundaries, not pre-shredded task assignments.

Grounding:
- Shape Up assign-projects-not-tasks (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/013-3.1-chapter-10.md:9`)
- Execution-lead stage split rationale (`framework/archetypes/execution/execution-lead/design/why.md:43`)
- Renkei role terms and anti-drift boundaries (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:45`, `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:51`)

Negation test:
If autonomy is replaced by upstream task scripts, execution becomes ticket taking, integration quality drops, and leaders lose real status signal.

Independence test:
True across software and non-software project delivery where local discovery work is unavoidable.

### Truth 4: Stage ownership is a risk control and must be singular at handoff boundaries

Statement:
Cross-stage transfer requires one owner per stage and explicit acknowledgment semantics.

Grounding:
- Tech-lead handoff and acknowledgment fields (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/handoff-contract.md:17`)
- Execution-lead stage map (`framework/archetypes/execution/execution-lead/design/team-map.md:17`)
- Renkei stage definition (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:57`)

Negation test:
If stage ownership is shared or implicit, defects in package quality and defects in execution get conflated and no one can close the loop.

Independence test:
True in any staged process with upstream/downstream contracts.

### Truth 5: Validation is a distinct concern from implementation and must check sources, not plan checkboxes

Statement:
A completed plan is evidence of process completion, not requirement satisfaction. Validation must independently verify code against source requirements.

Grounding:
- `validate-plan` source-vs-plan rule (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/validate-plan/SKILL.md:30`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/validate-plan/SKILL.md:121`)
- `architect-opencode` final gate sequencing (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:473`)
- Execution-lead output expectation (`framework/archetypes/execution/execution-lead/design/why.md:40`)

Negation test:
If validation only checks plan checkmarks, upstream interpretation errors pass through undetected and production risk remains hidden.

Independence test:
True whenever plans are derived artifacts and sources are ground truth.

## 2) Ethos derivation (identity, tenets, principles)

### Identity (derived)

Because stage ownership must be singular and execution is distinct from preparation, execution-lead is the execution-stage owner: receives acknowledged package, orchestrates red/green/validation flow, and publishes stage-complete status.

Anti-identity (required to prevent drift):
- not product shaper
- not technical-preparation package author
- not line-by-line implementer
- not final decision owner on strategic scope

This aligns with existing scaffold boundaries (`framework/archetypes/execution/execution-lead/design/why.md:11`, `framework/archetypes/execution/execution-lead/design/team-map.md:24`).

### Tenets (derived)

1. Tests and source requirements are truth standards; execution does not redefine them.
2. Unknowns must be surfaced, not hidden behind checklist progress.
3. Boundary integrity preserves throughput; role blending destroys signal.
4. Validation is independent judgment, not implementation self-attestation.
5. Escalation is fidelity, not failure, when upstream defects are discovered.

### Principles (derived)

1. Orchestrate through explicit contracts; no implicit handoffs.
2. Keep red (`test-implementer`), green (`implement-plan`), and verify (`validate-plan`) as separate owned concerns.
3. Gate progression on artifact quality and evidence, not confidence language.
4. Route preparation defects to `tech-lead`; route shaping defects upstream beyond that.
5. Preserve developer autonomy within shaped boundaries (project ownership, not task micromanagement).

## 3) Doctrine derivation (process/orchestration/pipeline/output/handoff)

Doctrine should be minimal and stage-specific. It should not duplicate member-internal playbooks that already live in member archetypes/skills.

### Process (recommended)

1. Intake acknowledged execution package from `tech-lead` (hard gate: acknowledgment complete).
2. Preflight package completeness for execution start (plan + test spec + risk/dependency notes).
3. Delegate test implementation (`test-implementer`) for red-phase artifacts.
4. Delegate code implementation (`implement-plan`) against existing proof obligations.
5. Delegate independent validation (`validate-plan`) against plan + sources.
6. Synthesize stage outcome: pass, blocked, or escalate with defect owner.

### Orchestration (recommended)

- Parent orchestrator model, member specialists return to parent (matches team-map).
- Parallelize only when dependency graph allows (already canonical in `implement-plan` and `validate-plan`: `/home/brad/.claude/skills/implement-plan/SKILL.md:129`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/validate-plan/SKILL.md:162`).
- Preserve verbatim propagation discipline from Renkei vocabulary (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:233`).

### Pipeline (recommended)

`tech-lead -> execution-lead -> (test-implementer -> implement-plan -> validate-plan) -> stage-complete report`

This keeps execution-lead as team leader while preserving member ownership of red/green/verify internals.

### Output contract (recommended)

Stage package out should include:
1. test implementation artifact refs/commits
2. implementation commits mapped to plan phases
3. validation report with source-coverage status
4. unresolved defects with ownership route (upstream/downstream)
5. final execution state (`validated`, `blocked`, `escalated`)

### Handoff (recommended)

- Inbound: only acknowledged packages are executable.
- Outbound: only execution-lead publishes stage-complete status (already in scaffold: `framework/archetypes/execution/execution-lead/design/team-map.md:26`).

## 4) Team topology: parent/member rules and stage ownership

Recommended topology is scaffold-consistent and should be codified as doctrine contract:

- Parent leader: `tech-lead` (stage: technical preparation).
- Stage owner here: `execution-lead` (stage: execution).
- Members: `test-implementer`, `implement-plan`, `validate-plan`.
- Member default handoff: return artifacts to `execution-lead`, never cross-stage directly.
- Cross-stage publication: only `execution-lead` issues execution-stage outcome.

This is consistent with vocabulary semantics for Team Leader/Member and Stage (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:45`, `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:57`) and scaffold maps (`framework/archetypes/execution/execution-lead/design/team-map.md:11`).

## 5) Recommendation on where test implementation belongs and why

Recommendation: test implementation belongs in execution stage under `execution-lead` as a member responsibility (`test-implementer`), not in technical preparation.

Why:
- The red phase is executable artifact production tied to execution sequencing, not pre-coding concept shaping (`framework/archetypes/development/test-implementer/doctrine/pipeline.md:6`).
- `implement-plan` explicitly depends on committed failing tests from `test-implementer` (`framework/archetypes/development/implement-plan/doctrine/pipeline.md:15`).
- Keeping it in preparation would blur design vs build authority and create stage drift (contrast with `tech-lead` anti-identity: `framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/ethos/identity.md:7`).
- Shape Up building guidance supports integrated team execution and discovered-task handling in build phase (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/013-3.1-chapter-10.md:15`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/014-3.2-chapter-11.md:72`).

Boundary note:
Technical preparation should own test *design obligations* (contracts/spec), while execution owns test *implementation artifacts*.

## 6) What to avoid

1. Avoid truth inflation: do not include role-local preferences as truths (fails independence test).
2. Avoid doctrine duplication: do not copy full member internals from `test-implementer`/`implement-plan`/`validate-plan` into execution-lead.
3. Avoid stage bleed: execution-lead should not rewrite shape, redesign APIs, or silently patch prep defects.
4. Avoid validation collapse: do not let implementers self-certify completion without independent `validate-plan` pass.
5. Avoid over-specification: keep doctrine at contract/gate level; let member archetypes execute their own domain craft.
6. Avoid ambiguous ownership at handoff: no direct member-to-parent-of-parent publication.

---

Derivation quality check:
- Each doctrine recommendation traces to a stage/boundary truth in one mental step.
- No recommended doctrine item requires 3+ therefore links.
- Anti-identity is explicit to prevent role drift.
