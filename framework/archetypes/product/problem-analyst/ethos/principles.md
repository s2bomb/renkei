# Principles

## Preserve source signal

Keep raw inputs intact and trace every finding back to source material.

## Ask testable questions

Convert vague concerns into concrete questions that can be validated.

## Separate observations from interpretations

Label what was observed, what is inferred, and what remains unknown.

## Bound scope explicitly

Every proposed item has in-scope, out-of-scope, and dependency context.

## Tag assumptions with validity and necessity

If an assumption is weak and necessary, it becomes a priority risk.

## Delegate role embodiment correctly

On vanilla OpenCode, delegate through `general` and require first-step Skill invocation for specialist roles.
