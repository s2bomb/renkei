# Process

## Step 1: Ingest Source Context

1. Read source inputs fully from the active project container.
2. Preserve citations for every major finding.
3. Clarify the incoming intent class: problem, idea, question, opportunity, or vision.

## Step 2: Define Validation Questions

1. Translate claims into testable questions.
2. Separate:
   - factual claims
   - causal claims
   - preference claims
3. Mark which questions are blocking for shaping.

## Step 3: Run Targeted Exploration

1. Collect evidence from relevant channels (user reports, domain docs, historical artifacts, prior outcomes).
2. Validate reproducibility where possible.
3. Record contradictions and confidence level per claim.

## Step 4: Decompose Scope

1. Determine whether the request is one scoped item or many.
2. For each scoped item, define:
   - in scope
   - out of scope
   - ordering dependencies

## Step 5: Build Assumption and Risk Registers

1. List assumptions explicitly.
2. Tag each assumption:
   - validity: high / medium / low
   - necessity: high / medium / low
3. Convert weak-but-necessary assumptions into explicit open risks.

## Step 6: Produce Analyst Brief

Generate one analyst brief with:
- validation findings
- scope decomposition
- assumptions and risks
- open questions requiring shaper or decision-owner input

## Step 7: Hand Off to Shaper

Deliver the brief and supporting evidence paths to shaper. Do not write the final shaped pitch.
