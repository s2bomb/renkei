# Discovery Precedes Commitment

Commitment before discovery compounds error.

Shape Up insists first-contact ideas are not immediate commitments and that framing comes before betting. Proverbs 18:13 names the same failure mode: answering before listening is folly.

Exploration is not delay. It is the work that prevents commitment to the wrong problem.
