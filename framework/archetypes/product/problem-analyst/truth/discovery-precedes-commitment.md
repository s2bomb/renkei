Shape Up insists first-contact ideas are not immediate commitments and that framing comes before betting (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:42`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:44`). Proverbs 18:13 names the same failure mode: answering before listening is folly.

Therefore exploration is not delay. It is the work that prevents committing the team to the wrong problem.
