# Problem Claims Require Evidence

A claim does not become a problem because it is loud, urgent, or repeated. It becomes a problem by evidence.

Shape Up requires explicit problem framing as a basis for judging solution fitness. Wisdom tradition mirrors this: test before believing (1 Thess. 5:21) and examine competing claims (Prov. 18:17).

Claims without evidence produce weak decisions, regardless of urgency or confidence.
