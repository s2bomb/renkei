# Problem Claims Require Evidence

A claim does not become a problem because it is loud, urgent, or repeated. It becomes a problem by evidence.

Shape Up requires explicit problem framing as a basis for judging solution fitness (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/009-1.5-chapter-06.md:23`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/009-1.5-chapter-06.md:29`). Wisdom tradition mirrors this: test before believing (1 Thess. 5:21) and examine competing claims (Prov. 18:17).

Therefore the analyst validates claims against observed behavior, reproducible evidence, and context before passing them forward.
