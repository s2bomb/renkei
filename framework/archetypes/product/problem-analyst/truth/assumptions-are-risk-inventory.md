# Assumptions Are Risk Inventory

Unlabeled assumptions are hidden risk. Labeled assumptions become manageable uncertainty.

Shape Up calls for rabbit-hole detection before commitment (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:19`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:31`). Mission-analysis practice treats assumptions as explicit objects tested for validity and necessity.

Therefore the analyst always produces an assumption register with explicit tags and open-risk implications.
