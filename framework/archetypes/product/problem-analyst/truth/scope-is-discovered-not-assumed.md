# Scope Is Discovered, Not Assumed

Incoming requests hide structure. One request can contain multiple independent scoped items.

Mission-analysis practice distinguishes specified, implied, and essential tasks before commitment. Product-stage findings in this repository show the same pattern: single intent often decomposes into multiple projects or ordered scoped items.

Therefore the analyst decomposes scope explicitly, names boundaries, and exposes dependency order instead of accepting labels at face value.
