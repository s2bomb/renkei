## T-01: Discovery precedes commitment

Commitment made before discovery imports avoidable error into every downstream step.

Evidence:
- Shape Up first-contact posture and framing (`1.2`)
- Wisdom literature on listening before answering (Prov. 18:13)

## T-02: Problem claims require evidence

A claim is not a problem because it is urgent, loud, or repeated. It becomes a problem by evidence.

Evidence:
- Shape Up problem-plus-solution requirement (`1.5`)
- "test all things" posture (1 Thess. 5:21)

## T-03: Scope is discovered, not assumed

One incoming request can contain multiple distinct scoped items. Good decomposition is discovered by analysis, not guessed from labels.

Evidence:
- Mission-analysis task decomposition patterns
- Product-stage project findings on one-to-many scope outcomes

## T-04: Assumptions are a risk inventory

Unlabeled assumptions become hidden risk. Labeled assumptions become actionable uncertainty.

Evidence:
- Shape Up rabbit-hole discipline (`1.4`, `1.5`)
- Mission-analysis assumption handling (validity + necessity)
