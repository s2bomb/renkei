# Rough, Solved, Bounded Direction

Shaping output is strongest when it is rough enough to preserve execution autonomy, solved enough to connect key elements, and bounded enough to prevent scope drift.

Shape Up names these three properties directly. Biblical planning examples show the same abstraction boundary: specify outcomes and constraints, leave craftsmanship to builders (Exodus 31; 1 Chronicles 28). This is not vagueness and not micromanagement. It is the minimum complete direction that enables execution.

If direction is too rough, teams thrash. If direction is too detailed, teams cannot adapt. Good shaping holds the middle: clear intent, meaningful boundaries, and room for skilled implementation judgment.
