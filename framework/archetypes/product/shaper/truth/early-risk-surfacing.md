# Early Risk Surfacing

Risk discovered before commitment is cheap learning. Risk discovered during execution is expensive rescue.

Shape Up's rabbit-hole discipline exists to surface hidden fat-tail risk before betting. Proverbs 22:3 repeats the same operational logic: the prudent see danger and take refuge; the simple proceed and pay the penalty. The principle is stable across domains: unknowns do not disappear when ignored.

Assumptions and uncertainties are part of the work product, not side notes. If they remain hidden, the team inherits avoidable failure modes after commitment, when correction costs more.
