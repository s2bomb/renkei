# Constraint Creates Clarity

Constraint is not the enemy of quality -- it is the mechanism that forces prioritization and trade-off.

Shape Up's appetite model is fixed time, variable scope. The constraint comes first, then design follows. Luke 14:28-32 describes the same order: count cost before committing to build. In practice, unlimited scope degrades quality by removing hard decisions; bounded scope improves quality by forcing them.

Scope is the trade-off lever. When time is fixed, honest shaping cuts scope instead of hiding risk in implied overwork or silent slip. Constraint does not shrink thought. Constraint sharpens judgment.
