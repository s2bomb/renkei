# Multi-Lens Synthesis

Coherent product direction requires integrating multiple valid lenses. No single perspective is sufficient.

Shape Up describes shaping as integrative work across interface, technical, and business concerns. Product-trio convergence (Cagan, Torres, Patton) reaches the same conclusion independently. 1 Corinthians 12 provides the structural analogy: one body, many necessary parts; each part alone is incomplete.

Single-lens certainty is brittle. Durable direction emerges only when problem fidelity, feasibility, and value judgment are held together.
