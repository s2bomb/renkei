# Log: Shaper

Ledger of changes, decisions, and lessons learned during construction and maintenance of this archetype.

---

## 2026-02-25 -- Initial scaffold

- Created archetype directory at `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/`
- Established `design/` layer with: why.md, research/analogs.md, truths.md, log.md, synthesis.md
- Assembly directories created but empty: truth/, ethos/, doctrine/
- Grounding: product-stage-team.md (v1), product-stage-io.md (v2), product-stage-research.md
- Construction approach: bottom-up (truths first, then ethos, then doctrine). Analog research drives truth discovery.
