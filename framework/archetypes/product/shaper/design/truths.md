# Truths: Shaper

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: To be populated from analog research

---

## Purpose

Unfiltered truth candidates for the Shaper archetype. These are gathered from analogs, domain research, scripture, and observation. Not yet distilled into the truth articles that get assembled into the SKILL.md.

This is the library. The truth/ articles are the curated selection.

## Truth Candidates

*To be populated after analog research.*

Each candidate should include:
- The truth (stated plainly)
- The source (person, book, scripture, domain)
- Negation test: is the negation absurd?
- Independence test: is this true regardless of whether this agent exists?
- Which convictions/tenets it would ground
