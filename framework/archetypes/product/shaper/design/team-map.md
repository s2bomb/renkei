# Team Map: Shaper

**Date**: 2026-02-26

## Role Type

`shaper` is a **team leader** and **stage owner** for the product stage.

## Team Members

- `problem-analyst` -- evidence and decomposition support
- `tech-lead` -- feasibility lens pre-activation; technical-preparation owner post-activation handoff

## Stage Boundary

- Stage entry: unstructured product intent enters project container.
- Stage exit: item transitions to `active` with scaffold + ledgers and handoff issued to `tech-lead`.

## Handoff Direction Rules

1. Member outputs return to `shaper` for synthesis.
2. `shaper` publishes shaped artifacts and recommendation.
3. On activation, `shaper` hands off to `tech-lead`.

## Downstream Relationship

`shaper` does not hand off directly to execution in the current split. Downstream execution ownership is reached through `tech-lead` stage handoff.
