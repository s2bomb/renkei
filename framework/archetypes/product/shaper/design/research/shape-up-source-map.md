## Truth Candidate Mapping (T-01..T-07)

### T-01: Problem framing determines outcome quality

Source anchors:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:56` -- "flip from asking 'What could we build?' to 'What's really going wrong?'"
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:60` -- asks *when* the request appears, not just *what* is requested
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/009-1.5-chapter-06.md:23` -- always present problem and solution together
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/009-1.5-chapter-06.md:29` -- best problem definition is a specific story baseline

### T-02: Constraint is an enabling force

Source anchors:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:28` -- appetites start with a number, then design
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:30` -- fixed time, variable scope
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:36` -- "good" is relative to constraints
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:26` -- limits motivate trade-offs

### T-03: Good shaping output is rough, solved, bounded

Source anchors:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:70` -- Property 1: rough
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:74` -- Property 2: solved
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:78` -- Property 3: bounded
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:82` -- rough + solved + bounded operate as guard rails

### T-04: Premature commitment is the primary shaping failure

Source anchors:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:42` -- default response: "Interesting. Maybe some day."
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:44` -- too early to say yes/no on first contact
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:46` -- maintain poker face to avoid premature expectations
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/010-2.1-chapter-07.md:11` -- reject backlog accumulation and stale commitments

### T-05: Hidden risk must be surfaced before commitment

Source anchors:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:15` -- thin-tailed risk for well-shaped work
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:19` -- rabbit holes create fat tails
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:31` -- viability questions for unknowns and interdependencies
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:78` -- hunt for time bombs before commitment

### T-06: Scope is the trade-off lever

Source anchors:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:30` -- fixed time means scope must flex
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/009-1.5-chapter-06.md:95` -- no-gos explicitly cut scope
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:48` -- scope hammering as explicit discipline
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:65` -- must-haves vs nice-to-haves operationalizes cuts

### T-07: Coherent direction requires synthesis of multiple lenses

Source anchors:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:86` -- shaping is creative + integrative
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:86` -- combines interface + technical + business priorities
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:90` -- requires technical literacy
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:92` -- requires strategic evaluation of customer and business factors

## Team Composition and Stage Mapping (Shape Up -> Renkei)

### What Shape Up says directly

Shaping group:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/004-0.3-chapter-01.md:49` -- "a small senior group works in parallel to cycle teams"
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:98` -- two tracks: shaping and building

Decision gate (betting table):
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/011-2.2-chapter-08.md:39` -- stakeholders decide next cycle bets
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/011-2.2-chapter-08.md:41` -- Basecamp composition: CEO, CTO, senior programmer, product strategist

Build team:
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/011-2.2-chapter-08.md:31` -- one designer + one/two programmers (+ QA later)
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/013-3.1-chapter-10.md:11` -- assign projects, not tasks
- `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/013-3.1-chapter-10.md:15` -- team owns task definition and execution

### Translation for Renkei right now

This maps cleanly without forcing a square peg:

1. **Problem Definition stage** = shaping track output (pitch/problem framing artifact)
2. **Commitment gate** = betting-table equivalent (leadership decides what to bet next)
3. **Technical Preparation + Execution** can remain separate downstream stages in Renkei, even if Shape Up discusses them under one "building" umbrella

This is still grounded. It is not divergence for style reasons; it is decomposition for operational control in your agent system.

## Grounding Decisions from This Map

1. The current Shaper truth set is source-backed by Shape Up, not inferred aesthetics.
2. The Shaper output contract can and should explicitly include: Problem, Appetite, Solution, Rabbit Holes, No-gos.
3. Your "Problem Analyst" split is an enrichment decision (bias control), not a contradiction of Shape Up.
4. Leadership-driven top-down inputs are compatible: they still enter as raw ideas and are shaped before betting.

## Open Questions (to resolve in synthesis)

1. Should there be one `shaper` archetype with subagents, or multiple senior shaping archetypes with distinct lenses?
2. How strictly should Shape Up artifact language be preserved in Shaper doctrine output templates?
3. Where exactly does the Renkei technical-preparation boundary begin relative to Shape Up's "build" phase?
