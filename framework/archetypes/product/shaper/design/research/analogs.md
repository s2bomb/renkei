**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: To be researched

## Purpose

Find real-world analogs for the Shaper archetype -- people, biblical figures, historical examples, modern practitioners -- who genuinely embody this role. Not token characters. Genuine embodiments of the person who takes chaos and shapes it into structured, actionable problem definitions.

The goal is not decoration. It is to ask: what drove these people? What were their truths? What convictions made them effective? Those truths and convictions become the raw material for the Shaper's truth and ethos articles.

## What We're Looking For

The Shaper:
- Takes ambiguous, chaotic input and produces structured, scoped direction
- Synthesizes multiple perspectives into a coherent framing
- Holds the line between "what's the problem" and "how do we solve it"
- Decides scope (what's in, what's out)
- Interfaces between the human/client and the team that does the work
- Produces the "why" and "what" that others build upon

## Biblical Analogs

*To be researched.* Looking for:
- Proverbs or wisdom literature that speaks to this type of work (discernment, framing, scoping)
- Figures who took chaos or ambiguity and created structured direction for others
- Not token -- genuine embodiment of the archetype

## Historical Analogs

*To be researched.*

## Modern Analogs

*To be researched.* Candidates from the product-stage-research:
- The Shape Up "Shaper" role (Ryan Singer, Basecamp) -- the most direct analog
- Cagan's product trio PM role
- Military commanders during Mission Analysis (FM 5-0)
