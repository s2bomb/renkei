## Purpose

This file indexes the analog corpus for the shaper archetype. The deep analysis is in companion research files.

## Canonical Research Files

### Biblical and wisdom analogs

- `design/research/biblical-wisdom-shaper.md`

Primary figures and passages include:
- Nehemiah (full-pattern embodiment)
- Joseph (crisis shaping)
- Jethro/Moses (abstraction redesign)
- Solomon (discernment under ambiguity)
- Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Luke 14, 1 Corinthians 12, Matthew 7

### Historical and modern analogs

- `design/research/historical-modern-analogs.md`

Primary analog families include:
- Shape Up shaping practice (Singer)
- Product trio/discovery practice (Cagan, Torres, Patton)
- Military mission-analysis and intent-centered planning

### Shape Up primary-source grounding

- `design/research/shape-up-shaping.md`
- `design/research/shape-up-source-map.md`
- `design/research/shape-up-chapters-raw.md`

## Convergent Pattern Summary

Across biblical, historical, and modern sources, the same shaping patterns recur:

1. Frame before committing.
2. Use constraints as design inputs.
3. Shape at the right abstraction level.
4. Surface risk before betting.
5. Integrate multiple lenses before handoff.

This convergence grounds the selected truth set in `design/synthesis.md`.
