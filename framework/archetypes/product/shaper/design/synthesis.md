# Synthesis: Shaper

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: Skeleton -- to be written after analog research and truth gathering

---

## Purpose

This document links everything together. When complete, it is the specification that powers the generation of the Shaper's actual archetype articles (truth/, ethos/, doctrine/).

It synthesizes:
- `why.md` -- why this archetype exists, team fit
- `research/analogs.md` -- real-world analogs and what drove them
- `truths.md` -- gathered truth candidates

Into:
- Which truths to select for truth/ articles
- What identity, tenets, and principles to derive for ethos/ articles
- What process, orchestration, pipeline, and output contract to derive for doctrine/ articles
- The therefore-chains connecting them

## Truth Selection

*To be written.* Which truth candidates from truths.md made the cut and why.

## Ethos Direction

*To be written.* Identity, tenets, principles -- traced to selected truths.

## Doctrine Direction

*To be written.* Process, orchestration, pipeline, output contract -- traced to ethos.
