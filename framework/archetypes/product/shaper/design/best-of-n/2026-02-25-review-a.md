# Shaper Archetype Review A (2026-02-25)

## Top 5 issues (ranked)

1. **Environment leakage in assembled behavior (highest risk).**
   - The archetype hard-codes repo paths, harness APIs, and role invocation mechanics into core behavior.
   - This violates environment-agnostic behavior and will break portability outside this repo/tooling.
   - Evidence:
     - `truth/*.md` source anchors point to repo-local files (for example `thoughts/research/...`, `framework/archetypes/...`).
     - `ethos/principles.md` mandates `general` subagent + first-step Skill invocation.
     - `doctrine/process.md` requires `thoughts/projects/YYYY-MM-DD-name/` and `sources/`.
     - `doctrine/orchestration.md` includes `Task(...)` code and tool-specific skills.
     - `doctrine/output-contract.md` requires `[references/template.md](references/template.md)` and concrete output paths.

2. **Doctrine over-specifies platform mechanics instead of role behavior.**
   - The shaper should be defined by convictions and outcomes, not by a specific call pattern.
   - Current doctrine describes *how to drive one runtime* instead of *what shaping discipline must hold under any runtime*.
   - Result: brittle behavior when tools differ.

3. **Truth layer includes implementation citations that do not belong in assembled role text.**
   - The truth statements themselves are strong, but `Source anchors:` lines expose local research file paths in the assembled skill.
   - This creates accidental dependency on repo structure and distracts from conviction grounding.

4. **Identity language contains mild rhetoric and mixed authority framing.**
   - Phrases like "turn chaos into bet-ready clarity" are directionally right but read slogan-like.
   - "You are the leader of the product stage" + "You are not the bettor" can be tightened to remove ambiguity about authority.

5. **Output contract mixes durable structure with local file conventions.**
   - Required sections and quality gates are strong.
   - Hard path conventions (`{project_root}/working/...`) and reference links should be optional host adaptation, not archetype law.

## Concrete file-level edits recommended

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/truth/constraint-creates-clarity.md`**
  - Remove `Source anchors:` line from assembled article.
  - Keep only domain truth + consequence paragraph.

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/truth/early-risk-surfacing.md`**
  - Remove repo-local source-path citations.
  - End with explicit operational consequence (hidden risk raises downstream correction cost).

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/truth/framing-before-commitment.md`**
  - Remove local file anchors.
  - Keep framing-first truth in declarative form.

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/truth/multi-lens-synthesis.md`**
  - Remove path-based anchors.
  - Keep lens-integration requirement as role-grounding truth.

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/truth/rough-solved-bounded-direction.md`**
  - Remove path-based anchors.
  - Keep "rough, solved, bounded" as durable shaping criterion.

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/ethos/identity.md`**
  - Replace rhetorical opener with direct identity + responsibility + authority boundary.
  - Keep separation from technical design and final commitment authority.

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/ethos/principles.md`**
  - Rewrite "Delegate role embodiment correctly" to be host-neutral.
  - Remove direct references to "vanilla OpenCode", `general`, and first-step Skill invocation.

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/process.md`**
  - Replace repo folder mandates with host-neutral "create a working container" language.
  - Replace tool-specific delegation instruction with capability-based instruction.

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/orchestration.md`**
  - Remove embedded `Task(...)` API snippet and named tool-skill list.
  - Replace with protocol: assign role, pass role convictions verbatim, return contract, verify output against shaping criteria.

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/output-contract.md`**
  - Remove mandatory template path link and strict file path convention.
  - Keep required sections, metadata, and quality gates.
  - Add host-neutral clause: "artifact location and filename follow the active environment convention."

- **`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/references/template.md`**
  - Keep as optional reference scaffold.
  - Add one line: "Template is illustrative; adapt field names and storage location to host environment while preserving contract fields."

## Must keep strengths

- Truth set is coherent and convergent: framing-first, appetite constraint, risk surfacing, multi-lens synthesis, rough-solved-bounded direction.
- Tenets are mostly conviction-forward and operational under ambiguity.
- Doctrine quality gates in `output-contract.md` are strong and concrete.
- Commitment boundary is clear: shaper recommends, decision owner commits.
- Separation of shaping from technical design is explicit and correct.

## Proposed revised phrasing set (non-portable/weak -> stronger)

1. **Current (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/process.md:5`)**
   - "Ensure the project folder exists (`thoughts/projects/YYYY-MM-DD-name/`)."
   **Proposed**
   - "Create or confirm a working container for this shaping cycle using the host environment's project convention."

2. **Current (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/ethos/principles.md:29`)**
   - "When running on vanilla OpenCode, delegate teammates via `general` and require first-step Skill invocation for the target role so the delegate embodies the right archetype."
   **Proposed**
   - "When delegating, assign explicit role identity before task work begins so the delegate embodies the intended archetype behavior."

3. **Current (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/orchestration.md:13`)**
   - "Delegate using a `general` subagent and have it invoke the role skill."
   **Proposed**
   - "Delegate exploration to an agent capable of role embodiment, then verify the return against the shaping contract before synthesis."

4. **Current (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/output-contract.md:5`)**
   - "Shaped pitch document. Generate from [references/template.md](references/template.md)."
   **Proposed**
   - "Produce one shaped pitch document per scoped item, preserving the required contract sections; use a local template only as a convenience."

5. **Current (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/ethos/identity.md:5`)**
   - "You exist to turn chaos into bet-ready clarity."
   **Proposed**
   - "Your role is to convert unstructured intent into bounded decision-ready options."
