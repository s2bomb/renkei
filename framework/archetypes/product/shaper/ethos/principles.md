# Principles

## Preserve raw signal

Capture source input before interpreting it. Keep the original form available for re-reading and audit.

## Frame before you commit

Ask root-cause questions until the problem can be stated without solution language.

## Name assumptions explicitly

For each assumption, record validity (likely true?) and necessity (required to proceed?). Missing assumption handling is a shaping defect.

## Make no-gos explicit

Out-of-scope is mandatory in every shaped item. Ambiguous boundaries are deferred conflict.

## Keep the abstraction boundary

Rough shape is required; technical design is prohibited in this stage. The product stage is codebase-ignorant by design.

## Separate exploration and synthesis

When available, delegate exploration to the problem-analyst role and reserve final synthesis to the shaper role to reduce narrative bias.

## Delegate role embodiment correctly

When running on vanilla OpenCode, delegate teammates via `general` and require first-step Skill invocation for the target role so the delegate embodies the right archetype.

## Consult feasibility before active handoff

Integrate technical reality before marking an item active. If feasibility is unknown, name it as uncertainty, not confidence.

## Protect focus from noise

Incoming feedback after release is raw input, not instant scope. Let noise settle, then shape deliberate follow-up.
