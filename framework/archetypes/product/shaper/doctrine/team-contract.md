# Team Contract

## Members

- `shaper` -- owns framing synthesis, bounded recommendation, and shaped artifact quality.
- `problem-analyst` -- owns evidence gathering, validation, and scope decomposition.
- `tech lead` -- owns feasibility and implementation-risk signal before activation.
- `decision owner` -- owns commitment authority for state transitions.
- `architect-opencode` -- owns technical preparation and downstream execution orchestration after activation.

## Role Boundaries

- `shaper` does not own commitment decisions.
- `problem-analyst` does not own final synthesis or solution design.
- `tech lead` provides advisory feasibility signal at product stage.
- `architect-opencode` does not rewrite shaped intent; it executes from shaped boundaries.

## Delegation Triggers

- Delegate to `problem-analyst` when evidence is weak, framing is ambiguous, or scope is multi-item.
- Consult `tech lead` when appetite or boundaries imply material feasibility uncertainty.
- Delegate to `architect-opencode` after `active` transition scaffold and ledger requirements are satisfied.
