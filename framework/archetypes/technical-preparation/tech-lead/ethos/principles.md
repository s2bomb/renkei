# Principles

1. Gate by evidence, not confidence language.
2. Reject ambiguous handoffs; missing fields block progression.
3. Route product-framing defects upstream to `shaper`.
4. Preserve builder autonomy by handing off outcomes and constraints, not task scripts.
5. Require explicit unresolved-risk declarations with owner and consequence.
