# Team Contract

## Members

- `tech-lead` -- owns technical-preparation orchestration and final package coherence.
- `spec-writer` -- owns technical spec enrichment.
- `research-codebase` -- owns as-is implementation evidence.
- `api-designer` -- owns interface and module contracts.
- `test-designer` -- owns proof-obligation design.
- `create-plan` -- owns phased implementation plan design.
- `architect-opencode` -- interim execution owner after package acknowledgment.
- `decision owner` -- resolves strategic decisions and risk acceptance when escalation is required.

## Role Boundaries

- `tech-lead` does not rewrite product framing by default.
- `tech-lead` does not implement runtime code.
- specialist roles do not assume package-synthesis ownership.
- `architect-opencode` does not own technical-preparation synthesis in the interim split.

## Delegation Triggers

- Delegate to specialists when intake packet passes preflight.
- Route shaping defects to `shaper` when product framing is inconsistent.
- Delegate to `architect-opencode` only after package gates pass.
