# Unresolved Unknowns Expand Cost

Unknowns discovered late are more expensive than unknowns discovered early.

If unresolved technical or integration uncertainty reaches execution, variance becomes fat-tailed: schedules slip, scope control weakens, and emergency decisions replace deliberate trade-offs.

Therefore, uncertainty must be surfaced, reduced, or explicitly accepted before execution handoff.
