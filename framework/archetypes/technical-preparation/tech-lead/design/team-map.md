## Role Type

`tech-lead` is a **team leader** and **stage owner** for technical preparation.

## Parent and Children

- Parent leader: `shaper`
- Child members:
  - `spec-writer`
  - `research-codebase`
  - `api-designer`
  - `test-designer`
  - `create-plan`

## Stage Boundary

- Stage entry: item is `active` and intake packet is complete.
- Stage exit: technical package acknowledged as sufficient by downstream execution owner.

## Handoff Direction Rules

1. Child member artifacts return to `tech-lead`.
2. `tech-lead` synthesizes one package.
3. Only `tech-lead` hands off across stage boundary.
4. Interim downstream stage owner: `architect-opencode`.

## Satellite Usage
