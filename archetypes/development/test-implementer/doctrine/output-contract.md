# Output Contract

## Artifact

Committed test files implementing the test specification.

## Path Convention

Test files follow existing codebase conventions (discovered during test infrastructure research). No new directories or patterns introduced without justification.

## Completion Criteria

- All tests from the spec are implemented as executable test code
- Tests follow existing codebase patterns
- Tests compile/parse correctly
- Tests are committed separately from implementation code
- Plan checkboxes updated for completed test phases

## Completion Report

```
Test implementation complete.

**Files created**: [list of test files]
**Summary**: [N] tests implemented from test spec
**Status**: Tests committed, expected to fail (implementation phase is next)

Ready for /implement-plan.
