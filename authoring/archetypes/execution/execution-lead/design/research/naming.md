# Naming Study: Execution Stage Leader

**Date**: 2026-02-26

---

## Goal

Choose a name that is explicit, stage-aligned, and low ambiguity.

## Candidates

| Name | Pros | Risks |
|---|---|---|
| `execution-lead` | Directly names stage ownership and role | Slightly generic outside pipeline context |
| `delivery-lead` | Familiar in engineering orgs | Can blur with project management-only interpretation |
| `build-lead` | Clear build-phase framing | Understates validation authority |
| `execution-architect` | Signals authority | Collides with overloaded `architect` term |

## Recommendation

Use `execution-lead` for archetype id and preferred term.

Why:

- Clear pair with `tech-lead`
- Clear stage ownership semantics
- Avoids legacy `architect` label collision
