**Date**: 2026-02-26

## Required Primary Sources

1. Shape Up full corpus (foreword, chapters, conclusion, appendices, glossary), with emphasis on betting/building, autonomy, scope tradeoffs, and hill charts.
2. Current orchestration baseline:
   - `~/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md`

## Required Framework Sources

1. `docs/framework/AUTHORING.md`
2. `docs/framework/ARCHETYPE_WORKFLOW.md`
3. `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md`
4. `framework/AGENTS.md`
5. `framework/archetypes/AGENTS.md`

## Required Neighbor Archetypes

1. `framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/` for upstream handoff contracts
2. `framework/archetypes/development/test-implementer/`
3. `framework/archetypes/development/implement-plan/`
4. `~/.claude/skills/validate-plan/SKILL.md`

## Contract Audit Targets

1. Upstream intake (`tech-lead -> execution-lead`)
2. Member return contracts (`test-implementer`, `implement-plan`, `validate-plan` -> `execution-lead`)
3. Stage-complete output contract (`execution-lead -> decision owner/upstream leaders`)
