---

## Purpose

Identify real-world embodiments of the exploration/validation role: people or roles who investigate ambiguity, test assumptions, and decompose reality before commitment.

## Primary Analog Families

1. **MDMP Mission Analysis / S2 intelligence function**
   - Named assumptions
   - Specified/implied/essential task decomposition
   - Information gaps converted to collection requirements

2. **Shape Up shapers (analysis portions)**
   - Narrowing from raw request to specific problem baseline
   - Rabbit-hole discovery before betting

3. **Product discovery practitioners (Cagan/Torres/Patton convergence)**
   - Evidence-seeking before roadmap commitments
   - Cross-functional problem framing

4. **Biblical wisdom patterns**
   - Proverbs 18:13, 20:5, 18:17
   - Test before believing (1 Thess. 5:21)

## Convergence Summary

Across all analog families, the same pattern appears:
- Gather signal before judgment.
- Validate claims with evidence.
- Expose assumptions early.
- Decompose scope before committing resources.
