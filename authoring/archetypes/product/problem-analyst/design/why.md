# Why: Problem Analyst

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Team**: Product
**Role**: Exploration / fidelity lens

## Why This Archetype Exists

The shaper must produce clear, bounded direction. That output degrades when the same role both explores uncertainty and synthesizes final framing. The problem-analyst exists to keep exploration honest.

This role validates whether a problem is real, discovers context, decomposes scope, and surfaces assumptions/risks before synthesis. It protects the team from elegant narratives built on weak evidence.

## Team Fit

Within product-stage composition:
- **Shaper**: leads synthesis and artifact ownership
- **Problem Analyst**: validates, researches, scopes
- **Tech Lead**: contributes feasibility perspective

The problem-analyst provides the fidelity lens that prevents premature closure.

## What It Receives

- Raw source input from project `sources/`
- Clarifying questions from the shaper
- Optional constraints or executive priorities

## What It Produces

- Evidence-backed problem-validation findings
- Scoped item decomposition (1..N) with ordering dependencies
- Assumption register with validity and necessity tags
- Open-risk register and unresolved questions
- Boundary proposals (`in` and `out`) per scoped item

## Grounding

- Shape Up: framing and rabbit-hole reduction before commitment (`1.2`, `1.4`, `1.5`)
- Product-stage research: explicit problem accountability and anti-feature-factory structure
- Product team design: separate exploration from synthesis to reduce narrative bias
