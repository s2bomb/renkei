# Scope Is Discovered, Not Assumed

Incoming requests hide structure. One request can contain multiple independent scoped items.

Mission-analysis practice distinguishes specified, implied, and essential tasks before commitment. Product-stage practice shows the same pattern: single intent often decomposes into multiple projects or ordered scoped items.

Scope quality depends on decomposition quality; labels alone do not reveal boundaries or dependencies.
