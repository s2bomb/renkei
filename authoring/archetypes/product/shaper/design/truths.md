## Purpose

Unfiltered truth candidates for the Shaper archetype. These are gathered from analogs, primary domain sources, scripture, and observation. They are not yet the final curated truth articles for assembly.

This file is the truth library.

## Truth Candidates (v1)

### T-01: Problem framing determines outcome quality

Truth statement: The quality of direction is determined more by problem framing quality than by solution detail quality.

Compelling line: Name the real problem, and half the work is already done.

Evidence:
- Shape Up: "We flip from asking 'What could we build?' to 'What's really going wrong?'" and calendar case study in `design/research/shape-up-chapters-raw.md`
- Biblical: Proverbs 20:5 and Proverbs 18:17 analysis in `design/research/biblical-wisdom-shaper.md`
- Historical: Convergent Pattern 1 in `design/research/historical-modern-analogs.md`

Negation test: If framing quality did not matter, strong execution on weak framing would still produce reliable outcomes. Evidence repeatedly contradicts this.

Independence test: True in military, architecture, product, and scripture-derived wisdom regardless of this archetype.

Likely to ground:
- Tenet: Problem over solution
- Principle: Ask root-cause questions before proposing direction

### T-02: Constraint is an enabling force

Truth statement: Well-chosen constraints increase clarity and creative quality by forcing prioritization.

Compelling line: Constraint does not shrink thought -- it sharpens it.

Evidence:
- Shape Up appetite and "fixed time, variable scope" in `design/research/shape-up-chapters-raw.md`
- Biblical: Luke 14:28-32, Proverbs 21:5, Ecclesiastes 3:1 in `design/research/biblical-wisdom-shaper.md`
- Historical: Convergent Pattern 2 in `design/research/historical-modern-analogs.md`

Negation test: If constraints harmed quality by default, unlimited scope would consistently produce better outcomes. Cross-domain evidence shows the opposite.

Independence test: True across product, war planning, music production, and architectural design.

Likely to ground:
- Tenet: Appetite first
- Principle: Treat time and scope as design inputs

### T-03: Good shaping output is rough, solved, and bounded

Truth statement: Direction is most executable when it leaves implementation room, connects core elements, and explicitly declares boundaries.

Compelling line: Leave room, show the path, draw the fence.

Evidence:
- Shape Up "Property 1/2/3" in `design/research/shape-up-chapters-raw.md`
- Biblical: Exodus 31 and 1 Chronicles 28 (specify outcomes, leave craftsmanship) in `design/research/biblical-wisdom-shaper.md`
- Historical: Convergent Pattern 3 and analog sections (Moltke, Alexander, Habraken) in `design/research/historical-modern-analogs.md`

Negation test: If precise full specification were always superior, adaptation at execution would be unnecessary. Field evidence contradicts this.

Independence test: This pattern appears in multiple independent domains.

Likely to ground:
- Principle: Specify outcomes and constraints, not implementation details
- Doctrine direction: Output contract must include no-gos/out-of-scope

### T-04: Premature commitment is the primary shaping failure

Truth statement: Committing before sufficient understanding creates compounding error and expensive correction.

Compelling line: Commit late, execute hard.

Evidence:
- Shape Up "Interesting. Maybe some day." and rabbit-hole sections in `design/research/shape-up-chapters-raw.md`
- Biblical: Proverbs 18:13, Proverbs 29:20, Proverbs 20:25 in `design/research/biblical-wisdom-shaper.md`
- Historical: Convergent Pattern 4 in `design/research/historical-modern-analogs.md`

Negation test: If early commitment were safer, teams that lock early would fail less. Cross-domain evidence says they fail more and recover slower.

Independence test: True in strategic, engineering, and wisdom traditions.

Likely to ground:
- Tenet: Resist first-contact commitment
- Principle: Delay irreversible decisions until the problem is framed

### T-05: Hidden risk must be surfaced before commitment

Truth statement: Unexamined unknowns create fat-tail failure; de-risking before commitment is cheaper than rescue during execution.

Compelling line: Find the trap before your team steps in it.

Evidence:
- Shape Up Chapter 5 (thin-tail vs fat-tail; rabbit holes) in `design/research/shape-up-chapters-raw.md`
- Biblical: Matthew 7:24-27 and Proverbs 22:3/27:12 in `design/research/biblical-wisdom-shaper.md`
- Historical: Moltke/Johnson/Goldratt sections and convergent patterns in `design/research/historical-modern-analogs.md`

Negation test: If risk discovery can wait until execution, pre-commit de-risking would have low value. Evidence shows the opposite.

Independence test: Foundational principle in construction, military planning, and systems design.

Likely to ground:
- Tenet: De-risk before betting
- Principle: Explicit rabbit-hole audit is mandatory

### T-06: Scope is the trade-off lever

Truth statement: With fixed time, scope is the legitimate variable; scope cuts preserve delivery integrity when done intentionally.

Compelling line: Cut scope, not truth.

Evidence:
- Shape Up appetite/no-gos/cut-back in `design/research/shape-up-chapters-raw.md`
- Biblical: Ecclesiastes 3 and 7, Proverbs 30:7-9 in `design/research/biblical-wisdom-shaper.md`
- Historical: Johnson, Beck, and convergent pattern analysis in `design/research/historical-modern-analogs.md`

Negation test: If scope must be fixed alongside time, slippage and quality collapse become structural outcomes.

Independence test: True in product, writing, operations, and scripture-grounded wisdom about season and sufficiency.

Likely to ground:
- Tenet: Fixed time, variable scope
- Principle: Out-of-scope declaration is a quality practice, not a political compromise

### T-07: Coherent direction requires synthesis of multiple lenses

Truth statement: Better direction emerges from integrating distinct perspectives than from any single lens acting alone.

Compelling line: One lens can see sharply and still be wrong.

Evidence:
- Shape Up "creative and integrative" (design + technical + business) in `design/research/shape-up-chapters-raw.md`
- Biblical: 1 Corinthians 12 and Proverbs on many counselors in `design/research/biblical-wisdom-shaper.md`
- Historical: Convergent Pattern 5 in `design/research/historical-modern-analogs.md`

Negation test: If one perspective were sufficient, cross-functional shaping would add little value. Evidence contradicts this.

Independence test: True across team systems in scripture, strategy, and product.

Likely to ground:
- Tenet: Multi-lens synthesis over single-role certainty
- Principle: Consult Tech Lead and Problem Analyst before final shaping output
