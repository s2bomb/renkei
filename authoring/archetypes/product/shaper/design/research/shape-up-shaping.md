## What Shaping IS

Shaping is working at the right level of abstraction -- not too vague, not too concrete. Singer places it on a spectrum:

- **Words are too abstract.** "Build a calendar view" gives the team nothing to make trade-offs with. "You're solving a problem with no context. You have to be a mind reader."
- **Wireframes are too concrete.** They define too much too early, leave no room for the team's creativity, and hide complexity behind false precision. "The more specific the work is, the harder it can be to estimate."
- **Shaped work sits in the middle.** Rough enough to leave room. Solved enough to show direction. Bounded enough to tell you where to stop.

## Three Properties of Shaped Work

1. **It's rough.** Everyone can tell it's unfinished. Open spaces where contributions will go. "Work that's too fine, too early commits everyone to the wrong details."

2. **It's solved.** All main elements are there at the macro level and they connect. "The work isn't specified down to individual tasks, but the overall solution is spelled out." Open questions and rabbit holes have been removed.

3. **It's bounded.** Indicates what NOT to do. "There's a specific appetite -- the amount of time the team is allowed to spend on the project. Completing the project within that fixed amount of time requires limiting the scope and leaving specific things out."

"Taken together, the roughness leaves room for the team to resolve all the details, while the solution and boundaries act like guard rails."

## Who Shapes

"Shaping is creative and integrative. It requires combining interface ideas with technical possibilities with business priorities."

- **Primarily design work.** "The shaped concept is an interaction design viewed from the user's perspective. It defines what the feature does, how it works, and where it fits into existing flows."
- **Technically literate.** "You don't need to be a programmer to shape, but you need to be technically literate. You should be able to judge what's possible, what's easy and what's hard."
- **Strategic.** "Setting the appetite and coming up with a solution requires you to be critical about the problem. What are we trying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?"
- **Closed-door.** "Shaping is a closed-door, creative process. You might be alone sketching on paper or in front of a whiteboard with a close collaborator. There'll be rough diagrams in front of you that nobody outside the room would be able to interpret."

## The Four Steps

### Step 1: Set Boundaries

**Appetite first.** "Sometimes an idea gets us excited right away. In that case we need to temper the excitement by checking whether this is really something we're going to be able to invest time in or not."

The appetite is NOT an estimate. "Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design. We use the appetite as a creative constraint on the design process."

**Fixed time, variable scope.** "This principle is key to successfully defining and shipping projects." The appetite constrains what kind of solution you design. "Without the pressure of the fixed deadline, I wouldn't make the trade-off."

**"Good" is relative.** "There's no absolute definition of 'the best' solution. The best is relative to your constraints. The ultimate meal might be a ten course dinner. But when you're hungry and in a hurry, a hot dog is perfect."

**Default response to raw ideas: "Interesting. Maybe some day."** A very soft "no" that leaves options open. "It's too early to say 'yes' or 'no' on first contact... We need to do work on the idea before it's shaped enough to bet resources on."

**Narrow the problem.** "In addition to setting the appetite, we usually need to narrow down our understanding of the problem." The critical move: flip from "What could we build?" to "What's really going wrong?"

The calendar case study: Instead of asking what the calendar should look like, they asked *when* the customer wanted a calendar. What was she doing when the thought occurred? This revealed the real need: "see free spaces" not "do everything a calendar does."

**Watch out for grab-bags.** "When someone proposes something like 'redesign the Files section,' that's a grab-bag, not a project." The tell-tale sign: the "2.0" label.

### Step 2: Find the Elements (Rough Out the Solution)

**Move at the right speed.** Two enablers: the right people (or nobody) in the room, and the right level of detail (not wireframes).

**Breadboarding.** Three elements: places (screens/dialogs), affordances (buttons/fields/copy), connection lines (navigation). "We use words for everything instead of pictures." The topology matters, not the visual layout.

**Fat marker sketches.** For inherently visual ideas. "A sketch made with such broad strokes that adding detail is difficult or impossible."

**Elements are the output.** Not a spec. "More like the boundaries and rules of a game. It could go in countless different ways once it's time to play."

**Room for designers.** "Working at the right 'level of abstraction' not only ensures we move at the right speed, it also leaves this important room for creativity in the later stages."

### Step 3: Address Risks and Rabbit Holes

**Thin-tailed vs fat-tailed risk.** Well-shaped work looks like a thin-tailed distribution. Rabbit holes create fat tails -- "the project could take multiple times the original appetite to complete."

**Walk through use cases in slow motion.** "Given the solution we sketched, how exactly would a user get from the starting point to the end?"

**Question viability of each part:**
- Does this require new technical work we've never done before?
- Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
- Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn't come up with ourselves?
- Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance?

**Patch holes.** The to-do groups example: realized they hadn't addressed completed items. Instead of pushing the problem to the team, they decided on a compromise solution during shaping. "As shapers, we're thinking less about the ultimate design and more about basic quality and risk."

**Declare out of bounds.** Explicitly mark cases you're NOT supporting.

**Cut back.** Things you got excited about during sketching that aren't necessary.

**Present to technical experts.** "Is X possible in 6 weeks?" not "Is X possible?" -- very different questions. "We're really hunting for time bombs." Keep the clay wet -- whiteboard, don't slideshow.

### Step 4: Write the Pitch

Five ingredients:
1. **Problem** -- "The raw idea, a use case, or something we've seen that motivates us to work on this." Always present problem AND solution together. "Without a specific problem, there's no test of fitness."
2. **Appetite** -- "Another part of the problem definition." Prevents unproductive conversations. "It takes work and design insight to get to a simple idea that fits in a small time box."
3. **Solution** -- "The core elements we came up with." A problem without a solution is unshaped work. "Giving it to a team means pushing research and exploration down to the wrong level."
4. **Rabbit holes** -- Details worth calling out to avoid problems.
5. **No-gos** -- "Anything specifically excluded from the concept."

## Key Cognitive Patterns of the Shaper

Extracted from the case studies and principles:

1. **Problem over solution.** The shaper resists jumping to solutions. They ask "what's really going wrong?" before "what could we build?" They dig into *when* the user wanted the feature, not *what* it should look like.

2. **Constraint as creative driver.** The appetite is not a deadline -- it's a design tool. "Appetites start with a number and end with a design." The shaper uses constraint to force clarity.

3. **Discernment over enthusiasm.** Default response is "interesting, maybe some day." The shaper doesn't say yes or no on first contact. They maintain a poker face to avoid setting expectations.

4. **Appropriate abstraction.** The shaper deliberately avoids both vagueness and over-specification. They know that premature precision is as harmful as ambiguity.

5. **Risk as the primary lens.** "We're thinking less about the ultimate design and more about basic quality and risk." The shaper hunts for fat tails and eliminates them.

6. **Scope as the trade-off lever.** When time is fixed, scope is what flexes. The shaper decides what's in and what's out. "Cutting scope isn't lowering quality."

7. **Integration.** The shaper combines interface ideas + technical possibilities + business priorities. They're a generalist, not a specialist.

8. **Closed-door, then open.** Shaping is private until it's ready. "Work on the shaping track is kept private and not shared with the wider team until the commitment has been made to bet on it."

## What the Shaper is NOT

- Not a project manager (doesn't track tasks or manage timelines)
- Not a wireframe designer (works at higher abstraction)
- Not an estimator (appetite is NOT an estimate)
- Not a requirements gatherer (synthesizes, doesn't collect)
- Not a decision-maker alone (presents to the betting table, doesn't have final authority on what gets built)
- Not the builder (hands off to a team that has full autonomy in execution)
