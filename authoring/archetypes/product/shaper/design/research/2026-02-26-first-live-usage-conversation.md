# Source: First Live Usage Conversation (2026-02-26)

## Purpose

Capture first real workflow feedback from live shaper usage so doctrine updates are grounded in operational reality.

## Key Signals

1. User needs a single source of truth for item state.
2. Separate `bets/` and `shaped-items/` concepts are cognitively redundant for this workflow.
3. Promotion to `active` should trigger item workspace materialization.
4. Every project and subproject should preserve `index.md`, `sources/`, and `working/`.
5. Decision and escalation observability should be append-only and artifact-linked.
6. Terminology in generic workflow guidance should use `user` or `decision owner`, not role-specific titles.
7. Shaper must explicitly know who to delegate to and when, especially handoff to `architect-opencode` after activation.

## Derived Constraints

1. State transition must be explicit and auditable.
2. Activation is a workflow event, not only a label change.
3. Active-item scaffold is required before technical-preparation delegation.
4. Problem-analyst and shaper need explicit team/capability maps to reduce orchestration drift.

## Doctrine Update Intent

- Strengthen shaper process for activation and handoff.
- Add team contract guidance to shaper doctrine.
- Strengthen problem-analyst orchestration and capability routing.
- Keep OpenCode-specific delegation mechanics explicit.
