# Independent Review C -- Shaper Archetype

## 1) Top 5 issues (ranked)

1. **Doctrine is environment-coupled, so portability is broken.**
   `doctrine/process.md`, `doctrine/orchestration.md`, `doctrine/pipeline.md`, and `references/template.md` hardcode host/runtime specifics (`general` subagent, `Task(...)` API shape, specific skill names, `thoughts/projects/...` pathing, `human/CEO`). Archetype doctrine should be host-agnostic and role-agnostic at the execution layer.

2. **Truth layer contains normative prescriptions mixed into known goods.**
   Multiple truth files end with imperative language or role behavior directives (for example, `framing-before-commitment.md` line 9: "Therefore shaping is...", and similar closeouts in others). Truths should state stable domain facts; role obligations belong in ethos/doctrine.

3. **Truth -> ethos -> doctrine chain is partially leaky and over-asserted.**
   The synthesis says selected truth set has 6 tenet directions, but ethos has 8 tenets. Added tenets (`Recommend, don't self-authorize`, `Keep the slate clean`) are valid operationally but weakly grounded in explicit truth articles; they appear injected from pipeline policy, not clearly derived from known goods.

4. **Role boundary language is inconsistent across doctrine artifacts.**
   Process/output/pipeline disagree on status vocabulary and section contract: `active|parked` vs `proposed-active|active|parked`; "6-component" in synthesis vs 5 core + optional intent in doctrine; this creates ambiguity in handoff quality and decision authority semantics.

5. **Doctrine is verbose where role doctrine should be crisp.**
   `doctrine/process.md` is highly procedural and partially implementation-biased (step detail + storage layout + delegation mechanics). For an archetype, this is too close to runbook. Keep doctrine concise and principle-constrained so it survives host/runtime shifts.

## 2) Concrete file-level edits recommended

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/process.md`
  - Remove filesystem-specific requirements (`thoughts/projects/...`, `sources/`, `working/`) and restate as abstract artifact constraints (`project container`, `source capture`, `shaped output location decided by harness/project convention`).
  - Remove `general` subagent references; replace with role-level requirement: "delegate exploration to problem-analysis role embodiment via host-supported mechanism."
  - Collapse to 6 steps by merging current Steps 7 and 8 into a single "State + Handoff" closure.

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/orchestration.md`
  - Delete host-specific `Task(...)` pseudocode block.
  - Replace with host-agnostic delegation contract: required inputs, required return fields, and "must embody target role before work begins" as doctrine.
  - Replace explicit skill names list with capability categories (problem exploration, codebase research, external research).

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md`
  - Replace concrete tool chain (`create-project -> ... -> spec-writer/...`) with abstract stage contract (`intake -> shaping -> decision gate -> technical preparation -> execution`).
  - Remove "human/CEO" wording and use `decision owner` consistently.

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/output-contract.md`
  - Normalize decision states to one scheme used everywhere (`active|parked` OR `proposed-active|active|parked`) and enforce it in all doctrine + template files.
  - Make section contract strict: either 5 required + 1 optional everywhere, or 6 required everywhere. Pick one and align synthesis/process/template.

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/references/template.md`
  - Replace `Decision Owner: human/CEO` with `Decision Owner: <role or person>`.
  - Remove path assumptions from template guidance; keep only structural schema.

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/truth/framing-before-commitment.md`
  - Remove closing prescriptive sentence beginning with "Therefore shaping is..." and replace with a pure domain consequence statement.

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/truth/constraint-creates-clarity.md`
  - Keep factual trade-off framing; move "honest shaping cuts scope" style behavior directives into ethos/principles.

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/truth/early-risk-surfacing.md`
  - Replace role-directive closeout with neutral causal statement about cost-of-late-discovery.

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/ethos/tenets.md`
  - Either add explicit derivation hooks for `Recommend, don't self-authorize` and `Keep the slate clean` back to truth articles, or demote one to doctrine policy if no stable truth grounding exists.

- `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/design/synthesis.md`
  - Update tenet directions to match final ethos inventory exactly.
  - Add one-line truth anchor for commitment-boundary tenet and slate discipline, or explicitly mark them as doctrine constraints rather than ethos.

## 3) Must keep strengths

- Truth set selection is strong: five cards are non-redundant and high leverage.
- Ethos core is clear and useful: "problem over proposal," "appetite first," and "shape for builders" are sharp and differentiating.
- Separation of exploration/synthesis roles is a real quality control mechanism, not ceremony.
- Commitment boundary is explicit, which prevents role overreach.
- Output contract enforces shaped thinking structure and makes hidden risk legible.

## 4) Tightened 7-line ethos creed draft

1. We frame the problem before we discuss solutions.
2. We set appetite first, then cut scope to fit reality.
3. We treat boundaries as quality, not bureaucracy.
4. We surface assumptions and risks before commitment.
5. We integrate value, problem truth, and feasibility into one direction.
6. We shape outcomes and constraints, not implementation details.
7. We recommend clearly; commitment belongs to the decision owner.
