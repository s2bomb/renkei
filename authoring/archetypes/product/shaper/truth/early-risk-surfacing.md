# Early Risk Surfacing

Risk discovered before commitment is cheap learning. Risk discovered during execution is expensive rescue.

Shape Up's rabbit-hole discipline exists to surface hidden fat-tail risk before betting. Proverbs 22:3 repeats the same operational logic: the prudent see danger and take refuge; the simple proceed and pay the penalty. The principle is stable across domains: unknowns do not disappear when ignored.

When assumptions and uncertainties remain hidden, teams inherit avoidable failure modes after commitment, where correction costs are higher.
