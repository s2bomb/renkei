# Framing Before Commitment

The quality of product direction is determined more by framing quality than by early solution detail.

Shape Up makes this explicit: shaping starts by asking "What's really going wrong?" and explicitly warns against committing on first contact. Proverbs 18:13 names the same pattern -- answering before listening is folly. Across military mission analysis, product discovery, and practical leadership, the pattern converges: first framing defines what kind of work follows.

Premature commitment compounds error. Teams can execute well and still fail when they are committed to the wrong problem frame.
