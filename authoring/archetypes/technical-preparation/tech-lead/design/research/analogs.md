# Analogs: Tech Lead (Technical Preparation)

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Purpose**: Ground the role in durable analogs across scripture, history, and modern practice.

---

## Biblical and Wisdom Analogs

### 1. Luke 14:28-30 -- Count the cost before building

Signal: preparation before execution is not optional; beginning without sufficient preparation leads to public failure.

Role implication: technical preparation is the "count the cost" stage for software execution.

### 2. Proverbs 24:3-4 -- House built by wisdom and established by understanding

Signal: lasting construction depends on prior understanding, not only labor effort.

Role implication: execution quality depends on upstream design quality.

### 3. Hebrews 11:10 -- architect and builder are distinct functions

Signal: design and building are conceptually distinct responsibilities even when eventually unified in one authority.

Role implication: justify split between technical-preparation leadership and execution leadership.

### 4. Exodus 18:17-23 -- delegated judgment hierarchy

Signal: leaders must structure delegation and escalation to avoid overload and preserve throughput.

Role implication: this role is a delegating integrator, not a solo performer.

## Historical and Cross-Domain Analogs

### 1. Military operations planning staff (mission analysis -> course of action)

Signal: commander intent is translated into executable plans by specialist staff before operations commence.

Role implication: receives intent, decomposes constraints, integrates specialist inputs, and hands executable package downstream.

### 2. Chief engineer / systems engineer (aerospace)

Signal: complex projects succeed when one role owns interface clarity, risk integration, and cross-discipline coherence.

Role implication: owns integration risk and contract completeness across specialist outputs.

### 3. Master builder patterns in architecture and construction

Signal: drawings/specification quality determines build path, trade-offs, and defect rates.

Role implication: technical-preparation artifacts are structural constraints for downstream builders.

## Modern Software Analogs

### 1. Staff/Principal Engineer as technical lead

Signal: senior technical role aligns intent, constraints, architecture, and execution sequencing across teams.

Role implication: best modern analogy for this archetype's authority level.

### 2. Shape Up R&D senior team before production mode

Signal: senior technical participants settle load-bearing decisions before broad team execution.

Role implication: this archetype is the continuity mechanism from shaped product intent to build-ready package.

## Anti-Analogs

Patterns to avoid:

- Ticket manager who only tracks status
- Pure architect who never validates against codebase reality
- Hands-on implementer who bypasses delegation and collapses role boundaries

These anti-analogs degrade stage separation and reintroduce the overloaded-role failure mode.
