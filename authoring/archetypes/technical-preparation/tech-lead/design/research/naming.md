# Naming Study: Technical Preparation Leader

**Date**: 2026-02-26

---

## Goal

Select a role name that:

1. Fits the product -> technical preparation -> execution stage model
2. Signals leadership and technical authority
3. Avoids collision with the overloaded current `architect-opencode` label
4. Remains legible to modern software teams

## Candidates

| Name | Pros | Risks |
|---|---|---|
| `tech-lead` | Clear modern meaning; already present in product-stage team docs; signals stage leadership | Can be interpreted as execution-only in some orgs |
| `solution-architect` | Emphasizes design/preparation responsibility | Collides with existing `architect-opencode` mental model |
| `principal-engineer` | Strong authority signal; technical depth implied | Sounds like individual-contributor title more than stage owner |
| `technical-prep-lead` | Unambiguous to this pipeline | Less natural language; may feel artificial outside Renkei |
| `project-lead` | Familiar and broad | Too broad; loses technical-preparation specificity |

## Recommendation

Use `tech-lead` as the archetype name for now.

Why:

- It already appears in existing shaper contracts and pipeline docs
- It cleanly separates from `architect-opencode` without creating a brand-new term burden
- It maps well to product-trio and technical-lead analogies in known practice

If needed later, retain `tech-lead` as preferred vocabulary while allowing display aliases in harness UI.
