# Best-of-N Synthesis: Tech-Lead V1

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Inputs**:
- `2026-02-26-pass-a.md`
- `2026-02-26-pass-b.md`
- `2026-02-26-pass-c.md`
- `2026-02-26-pass-d.md`
- `2026-02-26-pass-e.md`

## Convergent Outcomes

1. Keep role name as `tech-lead` for V1.
2. Split boundary is stage-based, not title-based:
   - `shaper` owns product framing and activation packaging
   - `tech-lead` owns technical preparation package synthesis
   - `architect-opencode` remains interim execution owner
3. Package handoff must be explicit and acknowledged.
4. Shaper must hand off active items to `tech-lead` first.
5. Doctrine must enforce bounded retry/escalation and reject ambiguous handoffs.

## V1 Article Set Decision

Selected V1 assembly set:

- Truth: 5 articles
- Ethos: identity, tenets, principles
- Doctrine: process, orchestration, team-contract, pipeline, output-contract, handoff-contract

## Key Risk Controls Accepted

1. No silent intent reframing in technical preparation.
2. No execution start before acknowledgment contract passes.
3. Must-have and nice-to-have separation required in output package.
4. Two retries max before escalation.

## Required Adjacent Update

Update shaper doctrine and template references to route active handoff to `tech-lead`, with downstream interim handoff to `architect-opencode`.
