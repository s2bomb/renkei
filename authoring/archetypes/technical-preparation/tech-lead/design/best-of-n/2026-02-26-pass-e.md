# Pass E -- Adversarial Review of `tech-lead` Draft

Date: 2026-02-26  
Perspective: E (red-team, constructive)

## Framing

The current direction is strategically correct (split technical preparation from execution), but tactically under-specified in ways that can recreate the same overload under a new name.

Shape Up grounding supports the split only if we preserve four boundaries simultaneously:

1. Shaping owns problem framing and bounded direction.
2. Technical preparation owns de-risking and contract completeness.
3. Building owns discovered tasks and implementation autonomy.
4. Betting/commitment authority stays external to both shaper and builders.

If any one boundary blurs, the split collapses into title churn.

## 1) Top 5 Objections to Current Draft Direction

### Objection 1 -- The handoff target is wrong for the intended architecture

Current shaper doctrine still delegates directly to `architect-opencode` after activation (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/orchestration.md`, `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/process.md`, `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md`).

That conflicts with the stated new pipeline in `tech-lead` synthesis (`shaper -> tech-lead -> architect-opencode`).

Failure mode: two competing truths in the system prompt layer. Runtime behavior follows whichever instruction appears most salient, causing non-deterministic routing.

### Objection 2 -- `tech-lead` boundary is declared, but not enforceable

Draft anti-drift language says "does not implement code" and "does not reopen product framing," but no concrete reject conditions are defined in output contract terms.

Failure mode: when artifacts are weak, `tech-lead` quietly patches upstream shape defects and/or starts pseudo-planning implementation details. That violates Shape Up's handover principle (assign projects, not tasks) and destroys accountability boundaries.

### Objection 3 -- "Package complete" is binary with no confidence semantics

Current draft expects complete package + unresolved list, but not a required confidence profile per artifact.

Failure mode: false certainty. `architect-opencode` receives a "complete" package that hides uphill unknowns, then discovers rabbit holes during execution (exactly what Shape Up's rabbit-hole and uphill/downhill model warns against).

### Objection 4 -- Scope control is present in truths, absent in hard interface

T-05 names fixed-time/variable-scope, but the proposed handoff contract doesn't require explicit `must-have` vs `nice-to-have` decomposition at technical-preparation output level.

Failure mode: execution receives scope with no cut-lines, then either misses deadlines or performs ad hoc cuts without product-stage intent traceability.

### Objection 5 -- Migration plan is under-specified for real runtime adoption

The split audit correctly proposes staged transfer of Cluster A first, but there is no explicit compatibility period contract for shaper outputs and execution intake.

Failure mode: partial migration where shaper still speaks "architect-opencode full ownership" while tech-lead expects "prep-only ownership," creating duplicated orchestration or dropped steps.

## 2) Revised V1 Article Set (Truth / Ethos / Doctrine)

This V1 is intentionally minimal and enforceable, aligned to Renkei derivation constraints (1-2 therefores max) and Shape Up stage boundaries.

### Truth (3 articles)

1. `stage-boundaries-are-risk-controls.md`
   - Known good: shaping, betting, and building are distinct control points; boundary collapse increases hidden risk.
   - Grounding: Shape Up chapters 2, 8, 10; glossary terms `pitch`, `bet`, `discovered tasks`.

2. `unknowns-must-move-upstream.md`
   - Known good: unresolved unknowns discovered downstream multiply cost.
   - Grounding: Shape Up chapters 5, 13, 14; glossary `rabbit hole`, `uphill`, `downhill`.

3. `contracts-enable-composable-delegation.md`
   - Known good: delegation without explicit I/O contract causes silent failure.
   - Grounding: current `architect-opencode` quality-gate behavior and Renkei composability assumptions (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md` output contract semantics).

### Ethos (3 articles)

1. `identity.md`
   - "I am the accountable integrator for technical preparation, not a shaper, not an implementer, not a commitment authority."
   - Anti-identity is mandatory to prevent drift.

2. `tenets.md`
   - Contract clarity over heroic rescue.
   - Unknowns named now over surprises later.
   - Scope cuts are stewardship, not quality failure.

3. `principles.md`
   - Reject ambiguous handoffs.
   - Preserve builder autonomy by handing off constraints/outcomes, not task scripts.
   - Route product-framing defects upstream instead of patching intent locally.

### Doctrine (4 articles)

1. `process.md`
   - Intake active shape.
   - Run preparation workstream orchestration.
   - Synthesize one execution packet.
   - Gate readiness with explicit pass/fail checklist.
   - Delegate to execution owner and record acknowledgment.

2. `orchestration.md`
   - Delegation contracts for `spec-writer`, `research-codebase`, `api-designer`, `test-designer`, `create-plan`.
   - Parallel vs sequential rules.
   - Bounded retries and escalation path.

3. `pipeline.md`
   - Canonical: `shaper -> decision owner activation -> tech-lead -> architect-opencode (interim execution owner)`.
   - Explicit return path: prep-detected framing defects route to shaper.

4. `output-contract.md`
   - Defines minimum viable execution packet schema (see Section 4 below).
   - Includes hard fail conditions and confidence labels.

## 3) Alternative Naming Options and Final Recommendation

### Options

1. `tech-lead`
   - Pros: already seeded in current shaper docs; low transition cost.
   - Risk: commonly interpreted as coding lead, not prep-stage integrator.

2. `technical-preparation-lead`
   - Pros: semantically precise, lowest ambiguity.
   - Risk: verbose; awkward in prompts.

3. `solution-lead`
   - Pros: emphasizes translation from shape to executable design.
   - Risk: can be confused with shaper's solution language.

4. `execution-architect`
   - Pros: signals downstream interface.
   - Risk: collides with `architect-opencode` and worsens migration confusion.

### Recommendation

Keep archetype id as `tech-lead` for V1 compatibility, but make role display title explicit in doctrine and contracts: **"Tech Lead (Technical Preparation)"**.

Rationale: preserve current references while reducing semantic drift during migration.

## 4) Minimum Viable Handoff Contract to `architect-opencode`

Use a strict schema. If any required field is missing, handoff is blocked.

### Required payload

1. `active_shape_path`
2. `appetite`
3. `scope`
   - `must_haves[]`
   - `nice_to_haves[]`
   - explicit no-gos
4. `artifact_paths`
   - enriched spec
   - codebase research
   - API design
   - test specification
   - implementation plan
5. `unknowns`
   - `resolved[]`
   - `unresolved[]` with consequence and owner
   - uphill/downhill status per major scope
6. `risk_acceptance`
   - explicitly accepted risks + accepting authority
7. `decision_log_refs`
   - project/item ledger entries proving activation and prep completion

### Required acknowledgment from `architect-opencode`

1. `receipt_confirmed: true|false`
2. `sufficiency_for_execution: true|false`
3. `blockers[]` (empty only if sufficient)
4. `first_execution_step` (what starts immediately)

### Guardrail

`tech-lead` cannot rewrite shaped intent during handoff. If intent is defective, route upstream with explicit defect report.

## 5) Required Shaper Updates and Migration Sequence

### Required shaper updates

1. Replace direct post-activation delegation target from `architect-opencode` to `tech-lead` in:
   - `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/orchestration.md`
   - `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/process.md`
   - `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md`
   - `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/team-contract.md`
   - `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/output-contract.md`

2. Keep `tech lead` in product-stage contract as advisory pre-activation signal, but clarify this is the same role that assumes ownership post-activation.

3. Add one explicit activation invariant: "active transition is incomplete until `tech-lead` acknowledges intake."

### Migration sequence (safe V1)

1. **Phase A -- Interface first**
   - Update shaper doctrine to hand off to `tech-lead` only.
   - `tech-lead` performs prep and forwards to `architect-opencode` using interim contract.

2. **Phase B -- Contract hardening**
   - Enforce payload schema + confidence fields + reject reasons.
   - Capture defects as observable events.

3. **Phase C -- Responsibility tightening**
   - Remove residual prep orchestration instructions from `architect-opencode` prompt.
   - Keep execution + validation only.

4. **Phase D -- Rename clean-up (optional)**
   - Decide whether to keep `tech-lead` permanently or rename once behavior is stable.

This follows Shape Up appendix guidance to adapt practices by scale and to start with an experiment before full-system transformation.

## 6) If We Only Do 3 Things Now

1. **Change shaper's activation target to `tech-lead` immediately** to remove split-brain routing.
2. **Ship a strict handoff schema with fail-fast checks** (including must-have/nice-to-have and uphill/downhill unknown status).
3. **Narrow `architect-opencode` to execution ownership in writing** so technical-preparation responsibility is not duplicated.

## Final Position

The split is directionally right and overdue. The current risk is not conceptual -- it is interface ambiguity.

If V1 enforces boundaries through contracts (not just role prose), this becomes a real architecture improvement. If not, `tech-lead` becomes another overloaded prompt alias and the system reverts to the same failure mode under a new label.
