# Best-of-N Design Review -- Pass B (Role Boundary + Anti-Overload)

Date: 2026-02-26
Perspective: B (boundary rigor, overload prevention, transition safety)

## Decision

Adopt `tech-lead` as the archetype name now, with the role analogy **chief engineer for pre-construction**.

- Why this analogy: it captures integration authority before build authority. In Shape Up terms, this is the seam between shaped intent and autonomous building: reduce rabbit holes before betting/build pressure, then hand responsibility to builders.
- Why not `architect-opencode` as-is: current scope spans preparation + execution + validation orchestration, violating role anti-identity and increasing cognitive overload.
- Why now: Shape Up Appendix 2/3 explicitly permits scale-adapted structure and staged adoption. A clean split at this seam preserves momentum while reducing failure risk.

## Boundary Thesis

The split boundary is:

`product shaping output (active item) -> technical-preparation package -> execution orchestration`

`tech-lead` owns the middle artifact and its quality gates. `architect-opencode` consumes that artifact for execution.

This follows both systems:

1. Shape Up: shaping/building are distinct tracks; unknowns are reduced before commitment; builders own execution details.
2. Renkei derivation method: anti-overlap must be carried in `identity`/anti-identity and enforced by doctrine contracts, not left to runtime habit.

## Source Grounding (Concise)

### Shape Up corpus (Foreword -> Appendix 3 + Glossary)

- Foreword/Ch1: method quality determines execution quality; process is leverage, not overhead.
- Ch2-6 (shaping): integrative pre-work, risk removal, and explicit pitch contract (Problem/Appetite/Solution/Rabbit holes/No-gos) are required before commitment.
- Ch7-8 (betting): no backlog drag; bets are capped commitments with circuit-breaker downside.
- Ch9: senior technical leadership settles load-bearing structure in R&D mode before broader production delegation.
- Ch10-11: assign projects, not tasks; builders discover tasks through real work.
- Ch12-14: organize by scope, expose unknown-vs-known, and hammer scope to fit fixed time.
- Ch15: feedback returns to shaping; do not create debt by ad hoc commitments.
- Conclusion/Glossary: key operational primitives are appetite, rabbit hole, uphill/downhill, scope hammering, circuit breaker.
- Appendix 1-3: implementation mechanics are adaptable; truths stay constant; staged rollout is valid.

### Renkei framework grounding

- `docs/framework/AUTHORING.md`: doctrine must derive from conviction, not ad hoc rules.
- `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md`: enforce anti-identity, pipeline/output contract, quality gates, and verbatim propagation semantics.
- `framework/AGENTS.md` and `framework/archetypes/AGENTS.md`: one archetype one concept, design layer rationale, explicit orchestration boundaries.

### Current repo state grounding

- `tech-lead` draft already identifies overload in `architect-opencode` and proposes staged split.
- `shaper` doctrine currently hands active items directly to `architect-opencode`.
- `architect-opencode` currently owns full chain from requirements through validated implementation.

## V1 Article Plan (Truth / Ethos / Doctrine)

Design objective: make role drift structurally difficult.

### truth/

1. `preparation-bounds-execution.md`
   - Purpose: encode that execution quality is bounded by preparation quality.
2. `unknowns-amplify-late.md`
   - Purpose: encode cost explosion when unknowns escape into execution.
3. `integration-requires-owner.md`
   - Purpose: encode single accountable synthesis need across specialist outputs.
4. `design-and-build-are-distinct.md`
   - Purpose: encode role distinction between pre-build design authority and build authority.
5. `fixed-time-demands-tradeoffs.md`
   - Purpose: encode must-have/nice-to-have discipline as quality preservation, not compromise.

### ethos/

1. `identity.md`
   - Purpose: declare `tech-lead` as technical-preparation leader; anti-identity explicitly excludes coding ownership, product reframing ownership, and execution orchestration ownership.
2. `tenets.md`
   - Purpose: convictions around de-risking, contract-complete delegation, and explicit unresolved-risk disclosure.
3. `principles.md`
   - Purpose: operational epistemology -- gate by evidence, escalate ambiguity, preserve downstream autonomy.

### doctrine/

1. `process.md`
   - Purpose: ordered flow from active-shape intake through package assembly and handoff acknowledgment.
2. `orchestration.md`
   - Purpose: specialist delegation contracts (`spec-writer`, `research-codebase`, `api-designer`, `test-designer`, `create-plan`), retry policy, escalation policy.
3. `pipeline.md`
   - Purpose: explicit stage interface declaration and transition ownership.
4. `output-contract.md`
   - Purpose: canonical technical-preparation package schema and quality gates.
5. `handoff-contract.md`
   - Purpose: strict producer/consumer handshake between `tech-lead` and `architect-opencode` (kept separate from output schema to avoid drift).

## Split Matrix: Move Now vs Later

| Responsibility Cluster | Move to `tech-lead` now (V1) | Keep in `architect-opencode` now | Move later (post-stabilization) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active item intake from shaper | Yes | No | N/A |
| Spec enrichment orchestration | Yes | No | N/A |
| Codebase research orchestration | Yes | No | N/A |
| API/test/plan orchestration | Yes | No | N/A |
| Prep artifact quality gates | Yes | No | N/A |
| Technical package assembly | Yes | No | N/A |
| Execution kickoff acknowledgment collection | Yes | Consumer acknowledgment only | N/A |
| Test implementation orchestration | No | Yes | Candidate later |
| Code implementation orchestration | No | Yes | Candidate later |
| Validation loop orchestration | No | Yes | Candidate later |
| Branch/PR packaging conventions | No | Yes | Candidate later |
| End-to-end workflow ownership from raw requirements | No | Yes | Re-evaluate after `tech-lead` reliability |

Recommendation: freeze this matrix for one release window. Do not perform partial overlap migrations mid-window.

## Handoff Contract (`tech-lead` -> `architect-opencode`)

### Payload (required)

1. Active item root path.
2. `shape.md` path and item metadata (item id, decision owner, appetite).
3. Enriched spec path.
4. Research artifact path(s).
5. API design artifact path(s).
6. Test design specification path(s).
7. Implementation plan path.
8. Unresolved decisions list (explicitly empty if none).
9. Accepted risk register (explicitly empty if none).
10. Prep quality-gate report (pass/fail per gate).

### Producer quality gates (`tech-lead` must pass before handoff)

1. **Shape fidelity gate**: package remains inside Shape Up core boundaries (problem/appetite/solution/rabbit-holes/no-gos) without silent reframing.
2. **Contract completeness gate**: every required artifact path exists and is readable.
3. **Traceability gate**: each major plan phase traces to shaped intent and spec constraints.
4. **Unknowns gate**: unresolved items are explicitly labeled uphill/downhill and consequence-tagged.
5. **Scope discipline gate**: must-have vs nice-to-have markers exist in plan where relevant.

### Consumer acknowledgment gates (`architect-opencode` must return)

1. Receipt confirmation of all artifact paths.
2. Sufficiency declaration: "ready to begin execution" or "blocked".
3. If blocked: explicit blocker list mapped to missing/defective contract fields.
4. No silent takeover of shaping: blockers that are product-framing defects are routed upstream.

### Retry and escalation

- Maximum two correction loops for contract defects.
- On third failure, escalate to decision owner with missing fields + consequence.
- Do not begin execution on partial package unless decision owner explicitly accepts variance.

## Required Shaper Doctrine Edits (Exact Files + Intent)

1. `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/process.md`
   - Intent: change Step 8 handoff target from `architect-opencode` to `tech-lead`; keep feasibility consultation in Step 5 advisory only; require explicit transfer to technical-preparation leader on activation.

2. `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md`
   - Intent: replace pipeline segment `... -> architect-opencode -> execution` with `... -> tech-lead -> architect-opencode (interim execution)`; clarify that technical preparation is a distinct stage.

3. `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/output-contract.md`
   - Intent: update downstream contract section so active-item payload is handoff-ready for `tech-lead` first; include prep-intake fields needed by `tech-lead` contract.

4. `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/orchestration.md`
   - Intent: update team contract and mandatory post-activation delegation block to invoke `tech-lead` skill, not `architect-opencode`; keep `architect-opencode` as downstream execution owner (interim).

5. `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/team-contract.md`
   - Intent: revise role line for `architect-opencode` to execution orchestration only; expand `tech lead` from advisory feasibility in product stage to ownership of technical-preparation stage after activation.

## Anti-Overlap Controls for `architect-opencode`

To preserve safe transition, immediately narrow `architect-opencode` identity/doctrine language in next revision:

- Remove “full workflow from requirements” framing.
- Set input contract to "approved technical-preparation package".
- Keep execution and validation loops unchanged.
- Keep packaging/branching guidance unchanged for now.

This prevents two leaders from believing they own the same stage.

## Failure Modes If Split Is Done Poorly

1. **Dual-command ambiguity**: both roles issue preparation directives; specialists receive conflicting contracts.
2. **Shadow shaping**: technical-preparation role silently rewrites problem framing, breaking decision-owner authority and Shape Up boundary.
3. **Premature execution start**: coding begins on partial package; unknowns migrate downhill and explode late.
4. **Taskmaster regression**: preparation role prescribes task lists instead of bounded project intent, violating builder autonomy.
5. **Interface drift**: handoff schema evolves informally; acknowledgment becomes social, not contractual.
6. **Escalation collapse**: unresolved risks are buried to keep flow moving; failures surface only during implementation.
7. **Over-correction bureaucracy**: too many gates without explicit pass/fail criteria slows throughput and recreates backlog-style drag.

## Practical Rollout Sequence (Minimal-Risk)

1. Land shaper doctrine handoff edits first.
2. Publish `tech-lead` V1 archetype with strict anti-identity and handoff contract.
3. Narrow `architect-opencode` input contract to consume `tech-lead` package.
4. Run one active item end-to-end with contract logging.
5. Audit defects at seams; adjust only contracts, not role boundaries, during first stabilization window.

This preserves continuity while removing overload from the current architecture.
