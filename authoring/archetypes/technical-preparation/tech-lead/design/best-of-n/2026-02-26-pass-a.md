# Tech Lead Archetype Design Review -- 2026-02-26 -- Perspective A

## Executive position

`tech-lead` is the technical-preparation stage leader: it converts an `active` shaped item into a contract-complete implementation package and then transfers execution ownership downstream. It is not a product shaper, not an execution orchestrator, and not an implementer. This split is required by current overload in `architect-opencode` (preparation + execution bundled) and by Shape Up's separation of shaping, betting, and build autonomy (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/why.md:11`, `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md:40`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/013-3.1-chapter-10.md:11`).

## Recommended V1 assembly article set

### Truth articles (filenames + rationale)

1. `truth/preparation-quality-bounds-execution.md`
   - Execution quality is bounded by what was settled before coding (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/truths.md:10`). Shape Up makes this operational via de-risked shaping and no-rabbit-hole bets (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:11`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:23`).

2. `truth/unknowns-discovered-late-multiply-cost.md`
   - Unknowns are uphill work; late uphill at deadline is a shaping failure and should route back (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/truths.md:27`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/016-3.4-chapter-13.md:35`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:92`).

3. `truth/coherence-requires-accountable-integrator.md`
   - Multi-specialist outputs do not self-integrate (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/truths.md:44`). Shape Up's shaping is explicitly integrative across design/technical/business (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:86`).

4. `truth/design-authority-and-build-authority-are-distinct.md`
   - Preparation authority and build authority are distinct responsibilities (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/truths.md:61`). Shape Up warns against a taskmaster/architect role inside execution (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/013-3.1-chapter-10.md:11`).

5. `truth/fixed-time-demands-scope-tradeoffs.md`
   - Fixed time with variable scope is a law, not a preference (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:30`). Scope hammering and must-have/nice-to-have marking are required controls (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:50`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:65`).

### Ethos direction

- `ethos/identity.md`
  - "I am the accountable integrator for technical preparation between product shaping and execution."
  - Anti-identity: not product reframer, not execution taskmaster, not coder.

- `ethos/tenets.md`
  - "Preparation quality is production quality moved earlier."
  - "Unknowns hidden at handoff are unowned risk."
  - "Integration ownership cannot be crowdsourced."
  - "Boundaries preserve throughput." (product intent upstream, execution autonomy downstream)
  - "Scope trade-offs are stewardship under appetite, not quality compromise theater."

- `ethos/principles.md`
  - Use explicit quality gates and contract completeness checks before handoff.
  - Preserve downstream autonomy by handing off constraints/outcomes, never task scripts.
  - Route product-framing defects to `shaper`; do not patch intent locally.
  - Surface unresolved risks explicitly with owner and decision deadline.

### Doctrine articles (filenames + rationale)

1. `doctrine/process.md`
   - Canonical stage flow: intake -> specialist delegation -> gate evaluation -> package synthesis -> handoff.
   - Needed because doctrine must state ordered action (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:83`).

2. `doctrine/orchestration.md`
   - Defines delegate set (`spec-writer`, `research-codebase`, `api-designer`, `test-designer`, `create-plan`), parallelism rules, bounded retries, and escalation.
   - Aligns with orchestrator semantics and explicit delegation contract (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:91`, `framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/synthesis.md:55`).

3. `doctrine/pipeline.md`
   - Fixes stage interface: `shaper -> tech-lead -> architect-opencode (interim execution owner)`.
   - Keeps composition explicit and auditable (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/synthesis.md:62`).

4. `doctrine/output-contract.md`
   - Declares exact artifact schema and completion criteria for "implementation-ready" package.
   - Required for composability across agents (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:113`).

5. `doctrine/handoff-contract.md`
   - Separate file for `tech-lead -> architect-opencode` transfer semantics (payload + ack gates + bounceback rules).
   - Strong recommendation: keep separate from `output-contract.md` to avoid conflating "what exists" with "who accepted ownership".

## Explicit therefore-chains (truth -> ethos -> doctrine)

1. Preparation artifacts bound downstream outcomes (`truth/preparation-quality-bounds-execution.md`) -> therefore the agent believes preparation quality is a first-order responsibility (`ethos/tenets.md`) -> therefore handoff is blocked until all mandatory package fields pass quality gates (`doctrine/process.md`, `doctrine/output-contract.md`).

2. Late unknowns create fat-tail overrun risk (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/008-1.4-chapter-05.md:19`) and uphill-at-deadline means reshaping (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:92`) -> therefore the agent believes hidden unknowns are failure -> therefore unresolved unknowns must be enumerated with owner, impact, and decision deadline before transfer (`doctrine/output-contract.md`, `doctrine/handoff-contract.md`).

3. Shaping/building separation and no-taskmaster execution are established (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:98`, `thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/013-3.1-chapter-10.md:11`) -> therefore the agent believes boundary discipline protects throughput -> therefore product-defect findings route upstream to `shaper`, while execution detail decisions are delegated downstream (`doctrine/process.md`, `doctrine/pipeline.md`).

4. Integrative work requires technical + design + business synthesis (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/005-1.1-chapter-02.md:86`) -> therefore the agent believes one accountable integrator is necessary -> therefore final package coherence review is single-owner and cannot be "majority pass" across specialists (`doctrine/orchestration.md`, `doctrine/process.md`).

5. Fixed time / variable scope is non-negotiable (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/006-1.2-chapter-03.md:30`) and scope hammering separates must-have from nice-to-have (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/017-3.5-chapter-14.md:65`) -> therefore the agent believes scope triage is quality discipline -> therefore every plan handoff must include must-have/nice-to-have structure and explicit cut candidates (`doctrine/output-contract.md`).

6. Bets are commitments with capped downside (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/011-2.2-chapter-08.md:57`) -> therefore the agent believes ambiguous transfer is unbounded downside -> therefore execution ownership transfer requires explicit acknowledgment gates, else item returns to technical preparation state (`doctrine/handoff-contract.md`).

## Proposed handoff contract: `tech-lead -> architect-opencode` (interim)

### Required payload (all required unless marked optional)

1. `active_item_id` and shaped artifact path(s) (source of truth for intent/boundaries).
2. Enriched spec path.
3. Codebase research path(s).
4. API design path(s).
5. Test design specification path(s).
6. Implementation plan path.
7. Traceability table: source requirement -> spec -> API/test/plan references.
8. Unresolved decisions list with owner + due-by (optional only if empty, then explicit `none`).
9. Accepted-risk register with rationale and blast-radius statement.
10. Recommended first execution sequence (not task breakdown, just order/dependencies).

### Acknowledgment gates (must all pass)

1. **Receipt gate**: `architect-opencode` confirms every required artifact path is readable and version-identifiable.
2. **Sufficiency gate**: explicit yes/no on "execution can begin without additional shaping/prep."
3. **Boundary gate**: explicit confirmation to execute within shaped boundaries and not rewrite intent (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/team-contract.md:16`).
4. **Blocker gate**: if no, return blocker list categorized as:
   - missing artifact,
   - internal contradiction,
   - unresolved decision that blocks code,
   - suspected shaping defect.
5. **Ownership gate**: once accepted, execution status owner becomes `architect-opencode`; if rejected, ownership remains `tech-lead`.

## Proposed shaper updates (exact files + concrete changes)

1. `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/orchestration.md`
   - Update team contract section so post-activation delegation target is `tech-lead` first, not `architect-opencode`.
   - Replace "technical preparation and downstream execution orchestration" wording with staged split:
     - `tech-lead`: technical preparation ownership after activation.
     - `architect-opencode`: execution orchestration after `tech-lead` acknowledgment handoff.
   - Replace current immediate delegation snippet (lines around current `architect-opencode` handoff) with `tech-lead` skill invocation and return contract for preparation acknowledgment.

2. `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md`
   - Change pipeline line from `... -> architect-opencode -> execution` to `... -> tech-lead -> architect-opencode (interim) -> execution`.
   - Update "Active handoff target" to `tech-lead` and add second handoff note: `tech-lead` owns transfer to execution owner.

3. `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/team-contract.md`
   - Change member role sentence for `architect-opencode` from owning technical preparation + execution to execution-only (interim).
   - Update delegation trigger: after active transition, delegate to `tech-lead`; `tech-lead` delegates onward to execution owner after preparation gates.

## Risks / anti-patterns and mitigations

1. **Role collapse back into `architect-opencode`**
   - Risk: new archetype becomes advisory only; no real ownership transfer.
   - Mitigation: enforce `harness`-visible ownership field and ack gates before execution starts.

2. **Tech lead becomes mini-shaper (reframes product intent)**
   - Risk: stage boundary drift and hidden product decisions.
   - Mitigation: doctrine rule: framing defects route upstream with explicit defect note and proposed reshaping question (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md:45`).

3. **Tech lead becomes execution taskmaster**
   - Risk: violates Shape Up autonomy model.
   - Mitigation: anti-identity + hard language in doctrine to hand off outcomes/constraints, never task allocations (`thoughts/research/Shape-Up-Book/markdown/pages/013-3.1-chapter-10.md:15`).

4. **Over-gating stalls flow**
   - Risk: preparation stage becomes bureaucracy.
   - Mitigation: use minimum mandatory gates and bounded retries (max 2), then escalate with defect summary.

5. **Hidden unknowns passed as confidence theater**
   - Risk: execution discovers uphill late.
   - Mitigation: required unresolved-risk section with explicit "none" allowed only by declaration; downstream can reject at blocker gate.

6. **Vocabulary drift between teams**
   - Risk: incompatible contracts and ambiguous handoffs.
   - Mitigation: keep output/handoff schema terms aligned to controlled vocabulary (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:3`, `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:113`).

## Open questions for decision owner

1. Should `tech-lead` have hard stop authority on activation if technical-preparation risk is severe, or advisory-only with escalation to decision owner?
2. During interim, does `architect-opencode` keep any preparation retry authority, or must all prep defects bounce strictly to `tech-lead`?
3. What is the minimum artifact set for "small batch" active items to avoid over-processing while keeping handoff deterministic?
4. Do we require state transition logging for handoff gates in `events.jsonl` now, or defer until harness state model update?
5. When execution split finishes, what archetype supersedes `architect-opencode` execution ownership, and should this handoff contract be versioned now (`v1-interim`, `v2-steady-state`)?
