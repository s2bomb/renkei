# Best-of-N Review -- Pass C (Truth and Derivation Integrity)

Date: 2026-02-26
Reviewer perspective: C (truth quality and derivation integrity)

## Scope and Method

This pass evaluates the `tech-lead` archetype through the Renkei derivation chain: Truth -> therefore -> Ethos -> therefore -> Doctrine. The objective is to keep doctrine load-bearing but not over-specified.

Primary source set used:
- Shape Up foreword, chapters 1-15, conclusion, appendices 1-3, glossary (`https://basecamp.com/shapeup/...`)
- Renkei method and vocabulary (`docs/framework/AUTHORING.md`, `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md`, `framework/AGENTS.md`, `framework/archetypes/AGENTS.md`)
- Current tech-lead draft design artifacts (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/`)
- Current runtime orchestrator (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md`)
- Upstream shaper doctrine (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/`)

## 1) Recommended Truth Set (5 truths)

The current draft truth library is directionally right. I recommend the following curated set as the initial `truth/` article set.

### Truth 1 -- Unresolved unknowns at handoff create fat-tail execution risk

Statement:
If unresolved technical/design unknowns cross the commitment boundary, schedule variance becomes fat-tailed and throughput becomes unpredictable.

Why this is a known good:
- Shape Up explicitly distinguishes thin-tail vs fat-tail risk and ties rabbit holes to blow-up risk (`https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.4-chapter-05#different-categories-of-risk`).
- The technical-preparation role exists specifically to remove these rabbit holes before execution (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/why.md:16`).

Negation check:
- Negation: "Unresolved unknowns at handoff do not increase execution risk."
- Result: absurd in practice and contradicted by Shape Up's risk model.

Independence check:
- True regardless of whether `tech-lead` exists; this is a delivery-system property, not a role preference.

---

### Truth 2 -- Fixed-time bets require active scope trade-offs, not completeness preservation

Statement:
Under fixed-time commitments, delivery quality depends on active scope control (must-have vs nice-to-have), not on preserving full initial scope.

Why this is a known good:
- "Fixed time, variable scope" is a core Shape Up principle (`https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#fixed-time-variable-scope`).
- Scope hammering is required to finish in bounded time (`https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#scope-hammering`).

Negation check:
- Negation: "Fixed-time commitments can preserve full scope without active trade-offs."
- Result: contradicted by deadline reality and Shape Up's circuit-breaker framing.

Independence check:
- True for any fixed-time product system, with or without this archetype.

---

### Truth 3 -- Integration quality does not emerge from specialist outputs; it requires accountable synthesis

Statement:
Separate specialist artifacts do not become coherent by default; coherence requires one accountable integrator.

Why this is a known good:
- Shape Up defines shaping as integrative work across design, technical, and business lenses (`https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02#who-shapes`).
- Current draft identifies this same need (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/truths.md:43`).

Negation check:
- Negation: "Specialist outputs self-integrate into coherent execution packages."
- Result: contradicted by common interface and handoff failures.

Independence check:
- True across systems engineering, software delivery, and operations planning independent of role design.

---

### Truth 4 -- Design authority and build authority are distinct responsibilities

Statement:
Translating intent into constraints/contracts and executing implementation under those constraints are distinct responsibilities that should not be default-collapsed.

Why this is a known good:
- Shape Up separates shaping and building tracks (`https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02#two-tracks`).
- Shape Up building doctrine preserves team execution autonomy once shape is set (`https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.1-chapter-10#assign-projects-not-tasks`).
- Existing overloaded `architect-opencode` demonstrates practical role collapse risk (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/research/architect-opencode-split.md:10`).

Negation check:
- Negation: "One role should normally own both technical preparation and downstream execution orchestration."
- Result: repeatedly leads to overload, blurred gates, and weak accountability boundaries.

Independence check:
- True in many domains (engineering, operations, architecture/construction) independent of this archetype.

---

### Truth 5 -- Delegation scales only through explicit contracts and quality gates

Statement:
Multi-agent delegation remains predictable only when inputs, expected outputs, and acceptance gates are explicit.

Why this is a known good:
- Renkei defines `Output Contract`, `Quality Gate`, and `Pipeline` as composability primitives (`docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:113`, `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:205`, `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:97`).
- Current `architect-opencode` runtime behavior is contract/gate-driven at each command stage (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:84`).

Negation check:
- Negation: "Delegation remains reliable without explicit contracts/gates."
- Result: contradicted by both runtime evidence and standard orchestration behavior.

Independence check:
- True for orchestrated systems generally, independent of this particular role name.

---

## 2) Ethos Derivation from the Truth Set

Derivation target: one-step links from truths to convictions; avoid rules disguised as ethos.

### Identity (ontology)

I am the accountable integrator for technical preparation. I convert active shaped intent into an execution-ready package by removing load-bearing unknowns and enforcing coherence at handoff. I am not the product shaper, not the execution lead, and not an implementer.

Derivation:
- Truth 3 -> integration requires accountable synthesis.
- Truth 4 -> preparation authority is distinct from build authority.

### Tenets (axiology)

1. Unknowns left implicit are debts against execution certainty.  
   (Truth 1)
2. Scope stewardship is quality stewardship under fixed time.  
   (Truth 2)
3. Coherence is owned, not emergent.  
   (Truth 3)
4. Stage boundaries protect judgment quality.  
   (Truth 4)
5. Contract clarity is the moral minimum of delegation.  
   (Truth 5)

### Principles (epistemology)

1. Make risk visible before handoff: no hidden rabbit holes, no implicit assumptions.  
   (Truth 1 + Shape Up rabbit-hole doctrine)
2. Decide by appetite fit and baseline improvement, not ideal completeness.  
   (Truth 2 + `https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline`)
3. Evaluate artifacts by explicit gates, not narrative confidence.  
   (Truth 5)
4. Route product-framing defects upstream; do not silently redesign intent downstream.  
   (Truth 4 + shaper boundary in `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md:45`)
5. Hand off outcomes and constraints, not task-level micromanagement.  
   (Truth 4 + `https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.1-chapter-10#assign-projects-not-tasks`)

## 3) Doctrine Derivation (article-level structure + why each article exists)

Recommended doctrine articles for initial assembly:

### A. `process.md`

Why it exists:
- Truth 1 and Truth 2 require a repeatable flow for de-risking and scope triage before execution handoff.

What it should cover:
- Intake active shape -> establish preparation gates -> orchestrate specialist artifacts -> synthesize -> handoff.
- Explicit stop conditions: missing contract fields, unresolved uphill risks, appetite/scope mismatch.

### B. `orchestration.md`

Why it exists:
- Truth 3 and Truth 5 require explicit delegation contracts to specialists and deterministic acceptance checks.

What it should cover:
- Delegate set (`spec-writer`, `research-codebase`, `api-designer`, `test-designer`, `create-plan`).
- Required contract fields per delegation.
- Retry/escalation policy (bounded retries).

### C. `pipeline.md`

Why it exists:
- Truth 4 requires explicit stage boundaries and ownership transitions.

What it should cover:
- Interim chain: `shaper (active) -> tech-lead (technical preparation) -> architect-opencode (execution)`.
- Re-entry rule: preparation-detected framing defects route back to shaper.

### D. `output-contract.md`

Why it exists:
- Truth 5 requires composable, testable handoff artifacts.

What it should cover:
- Package schema (spec, research, API design, test spec, plan, unresolved decisions, accepted risks).
- Readiness gate: package cannot hand off while critical fields are missing.

### E. `team-contract.md` (recommended)

Why it exists:
- Truth 3 and Truth 4 require anti-drift boundaries that remain stable as process details evolve.

What it should cover:
- `tech-lead` ownership and anti-identity.
- Upstream/downstream role boundaries with shaper and execution owner.

Note on over-specification:
- Do not encode per-command checklists at ethos level.
- Keep process normative but brief; let convictions handle edge interpretation.

## 4) Proposed Temporary Handoff Interface to `architect-opencode`

Goal: minimum viable interface for stage-1 split (technical preparation first, execution still in existing orchestrator).

### Handoff artifact: `technical-package.md` (one per active item)

Required fields:
1. `active_item_path`
2. `shape_path`
3. `spec_path`
4. `research_paths[]`
5. `api_design_paths[]`
6. `test_spec_paths[]`
7. `plan_path`
8. `unresolved_decisions[]` (can be empty)
9. `accepted_risks[]` (can be empty)
10. `readiness_assertion` (explicit statement that gates passed)

### Acknowledgment response required from `architect-opencode`

1. `received: true|false`
2. `sufficient_to_begin_execution: true|false`
3. `blocking_gaps[]`
4. `next_step` (either begin execution orchestration or return upstream correction request)

### Gate semantics

- No acknowledgment -> no ownership transfer.
- `sufficient_to_begin_execution=false` -> package returns to `tech-lead` with explicit gap list.
- Product-framing defect detected -> routed to `shaper`, not silently patched in execution.

Alignment references:
- Existing split proposal (`framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/design/research/architect-opencode-split.md:49`)
- Existing execution owner role scope (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:271`)

## 5) Proposed Shaper Changes to Hand Off to Tech-Lead First

Current shaper doctrine still routes active items directly to `architect-opencode` (`framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/process.md:112`, `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/pipeline.md:40`, `framework/archetypes/product/shaper/doctrine/team-contract.md:9`).

Recommended changes:

1. In `process.md` Step 8, change handoff target from `architect-opencode` to `tech-lead`.
2. In `orchestration.md`, make post-activation delegation mandatory to `tech-lead`; move `architect-opencode` to downstream target owned by `tech-lead`.
3. In `pipeline.md`, update active path to: `... -> tech-lead (technical preparation) -> architect-opencode (execution, interim)`.
4. In `output-contract.md`, update downstream contract payload to the technical-preparation intake contract expected by `tech-lead`.
5. In `team-contract.md`, change role line for `architect-opencode` to execution-only (post tech-lead handoff).

Important boundary preservation:
- Keep shaper's "feasibility consultation" with tech lead advisory pre-activation.
- Transfer design authority only after `active` transition and scaffold/ledger completion.

---

## 6) What to Avoid

### Over-derivation

- Avoid 3-4 step therefore ladders from truth to process minutiae.
- If a doctrine line cannot be justified in one mental step from ethos, compress it.

### Rules-as-ethos

- Do not encode ethos as NEVER/ALWAYS behavior lists.
- Keep convictions in tenets; put procedural constraints in doctrine only.
- Reference: Renkei prohibition on rule-substitution for ethos (`framework/AGENTS.md:31`, `docs/framework/VOCABULARY.md:253`).

### Role drift

- `tech-lead` drifting upward: rewriting product framing instead of routing back to shaper.
- `tech-lead` drifting downward: becoming execution orchestrator or implementer.
- `architect-opencode` retaining preparation ownership after split, recreating overload.

### Doctrine over-specification

- Avoid copying full command-by-command script from `architect-opencode` into `tech-lead`.
- Preserve the minimum necessary contracts and quality gates; let ethos govern edge decisions.

---

## Closing Recommendation

Proceed with a five-truth foundation (above), because it gives high leverage with low overlap and cleanly derives stage-specific ethos without importing execution doctrine. The split is valid if and only if the handoff contract is explicit and shaper routing is updated to make `tech-lead` the first downstream owner for active items.
