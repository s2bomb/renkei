# 2026-02-26 Architect Comparison Audit

## Scope

Comparative audit of delegation strength patterns in:

- `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md`
- `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/ethos/identity.md`
- `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/ethos/tenets.md`
- `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/process.md`
- `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/orchestration.md`

Goal: extract what makes `architect-opencode` a strong delegator and map transferable patterns into `tech-lead` without reducing the archetype to flat rule lists.

## Side-by-Side Matrix

| Mechanism | Architect mechanism (where it appears) | Tech-lead weak spot (where it appears) | Adaptation recommendation in archetype form (truth -> ethos -> doctrine) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identity-negation clarity | Identity is explicitly framed by negation and role boundary: architect is not researcher/planner/implementer and does not produce artifacts directly (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:11`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:16`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:644`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:651`). | `tech-lead` has a concise boundary statement, but it is broad and not mapped to concrete artifact non-ownership at identity level (`/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/ethos/identity.md:7`). Most concrete ownership boundaries appear later in doctrine (`/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/orchestration.md:40`). | **Truth**: stage-leader value is judgment and synthesis; specialist value is artifact authorship. **Ethos**: identity should negate specific role confusions (authoring, specialist substitution, execution ownership) as category errors, not style preferences. **Doctrine**: add an identity-to-ownership mapping article or section that ties each artifact type to its owner and states `tech-lead` operates as gate and integrator. |
| Explicit anti-self-production constraints | Anti-self-production is repeated in multiple loci: critical rules (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:39`), command-specific warnings (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:88`), and endcap reminders (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:644`). | Current constraint exists but is softened by qualifier language (`in normal operation`) and fallback role-collapse permission (`/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/process.md:34`). This preserves flexibility but weakens default delegator spine. | **Truth**: self-production by a coordinator hides quality defects and erodes auditability. **Ethos**: prefer explicit blocked escalation over silent role collapse. **Doctrine**: keep emergency role-collapse path, but make it an explicit exception contract: trigger conditions, required authorization source, and event evidence. This preserves non-self-production as the normative path without brittle absolutism. |
| Checkpoint interrupt when agent starts doing delegated work | Architect contains direct interrupt language that catches drift in real time (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:64`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:659`). | `tech-lead` defines ownership and retries but lacks explicit self-drift interrupt text that says what to do at the moment of deviation (`/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/process.md:37`, `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/orchestration.md:46`). | **Truth**: orchestration drift starts as small convenience and ends as boundary collapse. **Ethos**: deviation detection is part of integrity, not optional discipline. **Doctrine**: add a short interruption primitive: if `tech-lead` begins member-owned production, stop, record drift event, and either re-delegate or escalate authorization decision. |
| Delegation template concreteness | Architect provides reusable prompt template and complete call-site examples with first-action Skill invocation (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:50`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:54`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:94`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:375`). | `tech-lead` has protocol intent but thin call-site guidance: generic three bullets for delegation, no canonical template payload, no per-specialist argument contract examples (`/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/orchestration.md:11`, `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/orchestration.md:12`). | **Truth**: weak call sites produce variable delegate behavior, which degrades repeatability. **Ethos**: precision in handoff language is stewardship of downstream work. **Doctrine**: add one canonical delegation skeleton plus one minimal filled example per specialist, with required input fields and expected return fields. Keep it contract-oriented, not procedural micromanagement. |
| Pipeline "you are here" orientation | Architect has explicit phase map, section pipeline graph, and state-tracking expectations (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:402`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:431`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:600`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:605`). | `tech-lead` has dependency rules and two macro process blocks, but not an operator-visible stage position model across active items (`/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/process.md:21`, `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/process.md:56`, `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/orchestration.md:23`). | **Truth**: leaders lose control first by losing location awareness in the pipeline. **Ethos**: maintain explicit stage awareness as a duty to team throughput. **Doctrine**: add a compact stage-state schema (`current_stage`, `next_stage`, `blocking_field`, `owner`) and require state refresh after each delegate return. This gives orientation without introducing pseudo-service internal phase returns. |
| Quality gates and iteration loops | Architect uses artifact-specific feedback signals and a universal post-delegation loop (`/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:106`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:157`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:510`, `/home/brad/.claude/skills/architect-opencode/SKILL.md:523`). | `tech-lead` already has gating and retries (`/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/process.md:37`, `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/process.md:41`, `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/orchestration.md:48`, `/home/brad/Code/s2bomb/renkei/renkei-wt-1/framework/archetypes/technical-preparation/tech-lead/doctrine/orchestration.md:59`), but checks are generic and not artifact-shaped. | **Truth**: generic gates catch format failure but miss semantic incompleteness. **Ethos**: quality means contract truthfulness, not checkbox throughput. **Doctrine**: preserve generic universal gates, then layer concise artifact-specific minimum signals for each specialist output (spec/research/design/test-plan/implementation plan), with explicit re-delegation payload fields. |

## What to copy, what to adapt, what to avoid

### What to copy

- Multi-anchor boundary reinforcement: keep role boundaries visible in identity, process, and final reminders, not only one section.
- Post-delegation evaluate-or-iterate loop as a standing behavior, not ad hoc judgment.
- Concrete delegation call-site templates that force skill-first invocation and structured return contracts.
- Stage-orientation scaffolding (`you are here` state) so leadership remains operationally legible across concurrent items.

### What to adapt

- Convert architect-style `NEVER` stacks into conviction-grounded doctrine clauses tied to existing `tech-lead` tenets (`hidden unknowns`, `integration ownership`, `boundaries`).
- Keep role-collapse as a constrained exception path instead of total prohibition, but require explicit authorization and event evidence.
- Make quality gates artifact-specific while preserving the current team-level retry and escalation economics.
- Use compact templates that define inputs and return contract only, consistent with Renkei function-contract doctrine.

### What to avoid

- Copying prohibition-heavy language verbatim as flat controls; this risks rule spam and weak derivation.
- Embedding delegate internal process details in tech-lead prompts; call sites should define input and return contract, not callee internals.
- Turning stage orientation into non-terminal milestone returns (`intake`, `preflight`, `in-progress`) that violate function terminality.
- Overfitting to architect-opencode's end-to-end workflow scope; tech-lead should remain bounded to technical-preparation stage leadership.

## Net assessment

`tech-lead` already contains core delegator DNA: explicit stage boundaries, member ownership, retries, and blocked escalation. The biggest gap versus `architect-opencode` is not principle but operational concreteness: interruption mechanics, delegation template specificity, artifact-shaped quality signals, and explicit stage-location tracking. The transfer path is to strengthen those in doctrine while grounding each addition in existing tenets, so capability increases without abandoning truth -> ethos -> doctrine coherence.
