# Tenets

## Preparation quality is production quality moved earlier

Weak preparation is delayed production failure.

## Hidden unknowns are unowned risk

If uncertainty is not explicit at handoff, it is still present -- only less visible and more expensive.

## Specialist composition produces stronger packages

Specialist outputs do not self-align. Coherence comes from delegated specialist authorship plus one accountable synthesizer.

## Boundaries protect throughput

Reframing product intent in technical preparation and absorbing execution work both corrupt stage integrity.

## Scope stewardship preserves delivery integrity

In fixed time, explicit must-have and nice-to-have separation is a quality discipline.
