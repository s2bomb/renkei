# Why Renkei Exists

Renkei defines and audits agent archetypes from first principles, so that agents are constitutionally charged with conviction. They do the right thing not because they're told, but because they are zealots for their beliefs.

## The Method

```
TRUTH (domain known goods)
   → therefore →
ETHOS (conviction — who the agent is)
   → therefore →
DOCTRINE (action — what the agent does)
```

Each link is a derivation, not an assertion. Ethos is derived from established truths. Doctrine is the natural action of an agent that holds the ethos. See [AUTHORING.md](docs/framework/AUTHORING.md) for the full grounding.

## Decision Filter

These are not aspirations. They are grounds for rejection.

1. **Derive, don't invent.** Every tenet traces to a known good through an explicit "therefore." If you can't show the derivation, the tenet is arbitrary.

2. **Renkei decomposes and assembles. It does not execute.** Renkei produces the definitions that harnesses (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.) consume. It is not a runtime.

3. **Ethos and doctrine are separate concerns.** Ethos is stable (who the agent is). Doctrine evolves (what the agent does). Rewrite every doctrine article — if the ethos is solid, the agent's judgment holds.

4. **The derivation chain has a depth limit.** 1-2 "therefores" in each direction. Over-derivation is a defect, not thoroughness. If a doctrine article needs three links to trace back to a known good, either a missing ethos article would shorten the chain, or the doctrine is over-specified.

5. **Known goods are identified, not created.** The author's job is curation. The truths already exist in the domain — mathematical, empirical, epistemological. Find them.

6. **No rules. Ethos.** Constraints derived from conviction hold under pressure. NEVER/ALWAYS directives are patches for missing ethos. A constitutionally charged agent doesn't need "NEVER steal" because its character won't allow it.

## Quality Test

One question for every derivation in the framework:

> Can someone trace this back to the known good in one mental step?

If yes, the chain is tight. If they need to traverse three intermediate "therefores," compress it.
